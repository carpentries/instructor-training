This rubric is provided as a guide for Trainers evaluating potential new instructors during the final stage of instructor training checkout 
(the teaching demonstration). Deciding whether a particular trainee passes or fails the demonstration is the sole discretion of the
Trainer. As such, deviation from this rubric is encouraged as needed to accurately assess the trainee's preparation and instructional
skills.

In general, these demonstrations have a very low (<5%) failure rate. When a trainee is asked to redo a demo, it is simply a matter of correction -- an error to embrace and to learn from -- not rejection. Trainees who have three or more marks in the "Negative" columns below should probably be asked to redo their demonstration. Even one 
mark in a "Negative" column can be considered justification for asking a trainee to redo their demonstration if the problem is significant. As always,
Trainers should use their own judgement when applying this rubric in individual cases.
