#Data Carpentry Helper Cheat Sheet

Helpers are a very important part of The Carpentries workshops. Helpers suppport learners one-on-one if they are stuck installing software, understanding a certain line of code, or any other parts of the learning process.

###Before a workshop helpers will

1. Introduce themselves to the instructors, letting them know any particular areas of expertise
2. Review the curriculum the instructors will be teaching
3. Review the software installation instructions to be prepared to troubleshoot with learners
4. Make sure the instructors have listed you on the workshop website

####During the workshop helpers will

1. Help learners with setup problems or anywhere else they get stuck
2. Monitor room for anyone who may need help. Learners may put up a red sticky note or indicate in other ways that they are stuck.
3. Monitor any questions that come up on the etherpad and answer them or remind the instructor about them during a break.

###After the workshop helpers will

1. Send their own feedback to the instructors and the Workshop Administration Team including any configuration problems
2. Consider applying to become a certified Carpentries instructor


##Teaching Rules: 

####Rule #1: Be kind
- This means to be inclusive, respectful, mindful and welcoming.

####Rule #2: Remember that we are all learners
Admitting that you don't know everything helps create a growth mindset, where we are all constantly learning.
When you make a mistake, calmly talk about the error, how it's part of the process and necessary to make progress.

####Rule #3: Be aware of demotivating attitudes
There are several things that can be demotivating or impair the learners' experience. Examples of what not to do:

- Take over the learner's keyboard. Instead, encourage and guide them through the solution, but let them type themselves.
- Dive into deep discussions with more advanced learners (who might actually not need to be there). You can have those conversations 

####Rule #4: Be aware of demotivating words
Avoid saying things like: 

- Just: "oh, that's easy, you just..."
- "It's too easy..."
- "It's too hard..."
- "I can't believe you don't know X ..."
- Say negative things about any applications or OS (Word, Excel, Windows, Mac, GUI). No tool is perfect, and this kind of disdain is not productive or conducive to the learning process.
