Hello everyone,

Thank you for signing up for our upcoming instructor training workshop.

Please see this website for specific details about the workshop [INSERT WORKSHOP WEBSITE LINK HERE].

Importantly, class will be from 9:00 am - 4:15 pm both days. We will have a one hour lunch break and two short breaks each day. [INSERT WHETHER OR NOT FOOD AND DRINKS ARE SUPPLIED BY HOST].

**In order to prepare:**

1.  Please read this paper, which provides a brief overview of some key evidence-based results in teaching:

    * "The Science of Learning" (https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/files/papers/science-of-learning-2015.pdf)

2.  Please go to the Software Carpentry lessons page (http://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) and the Data Carpentry lessons page (http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/), have a look at what we currently teach, and then choose *one episode* from the list at the bottom of this message and read through it carefully. You will be using your selected episode for several in-class exercises, so be sure you are comfortable with the content.

**What to bring to the workshop:**

1.  We will be recording one another teaching in pairs or threes during the class, so please bring a cell phone or hand-held camera that can record audio and video. It doesn't have to be high-quality, but it should be good enough that you can understand what someone is saying.

2.  Please also bring a laptop powerful enough to teach on so that you can take part in all of the practical exercises and a power cable. You will need this laptop on both day of the instructor training.

**After the instructor training workshop:**

Please note that after this course is over, you will be asked to do three short follow-up exercises online in order to finish qualifying as an instructor: the details are available at http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/.  If you have any questions about the workshop, the reading material, or anything else, please get in touch. Also, you will hear about many ways to stay engaged with each other and with Software and Data Carpentry Instructors around the world, so we look forward to your continued participation!

Thanks again,

* How Learning Works (https://www.worldcat.org/title/how-learning-works-seven-research-based-principles-for-smart-teaching/oclc/762968489), which is an excellent summary of current research in teaching and learning

* Building a Better Teacher (https://www.worldcat.org/title/building-a-better-teacher-how-teaching-works-and-how-to-teach-it-to-everyone/oclc/953075081), a well-written look at why educational reforms in the past 50 years have mostly missed the mark and about what we should be doing instead.

* Small Teaching (https://www.worldcat.org/title/small-teaching-everyday-lessons-from-the-science-of-learning/oclc/968245403), which presents strategies for improving teaching practices that don't require significant resources.

* Teaching What You Don't Know (https://www.worldcat.org/title/teaching-what-you-dont-know/oclc/806492013), which is a situation many of us find ourselves in more often that we'd like.
