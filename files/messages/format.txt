Hi everyone,

Following up on earlier mail, we use Markdown [1] to format our lessons.  You can see the output at [2], and the source for that page at [3].  For your work, the two most important things are:

1. If you're submitted an exercise, format it as a quoted block using '> ' with a two-# heading styled as a challenge:

    > ## This Is The Heading {.challenge}
    >
    > This is the content.
    > It can span multiple lines, include bulleted lists, etc.

We put each challenge in a quoted block of its own so that they can be styled properly, and the '{.challenge}' on the heading tells GitHub to give this heading an HTML class of "challenge".

2. If you're submitting a diagram, put the image itself in the 'fig' sub-directory, and reference it in the Markdown like this:

    ![text title](fig/figure.svg "alt text")

The exclamation point at the start tells Markdown that this is an image link, rather than a regular hyperlink.  In most cases, the image title and the alt text will be the same, but you can add as much extra information to the alt text as you want.  (In particular, this is what assistive aids for the visually impaired, and search engines, pay attention to.)  Please note that we prefer SVG (a vector format) to PNG or JPEG (which don't scale up or down as well), but we'll take any of them and re-draw as necessary.

If you have questions, please throw them our way, or join our 'discuss' list and post them there.
