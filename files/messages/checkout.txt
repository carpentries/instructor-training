Hi everyone,

Thanks again for taking part in instructor training this week. I really enjoyed spending time with you, and I look forward to your continued involvement with the Software and Data Carpentry Communities. 

We'd be very grateful if you could take a couple of minutes to fill in this survey (https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/post-instructor-training) to provide anonymous feedback about the workshop.

In order to wrap up, we would like you to do the steps outlined in http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/:

1. Submit something for one of our lessons.

2. Take part in an online discussion session.

3. Teach a 5-minute demonstration lesson online.

If you have any questions or suggestions about these steps, please contact us at checkout@carpentries.org. Please note that we would like everyone to complete all three steps within 90 days of the training course.  If you are not able to do this, please contact us to discuss reasons and options.

Thanks again - we look forward to seeing you online.
