Thank you for participating in the instructor training discussion session last night. These sessions are a key part of bringing new instructors into the community and we closely monitor participants' involvement in them. It is our understanding that you were not able to play an active part in the discussion  yesterday. Please let us know  if you experienced any difficulties so we can explore ways to be of more support. This could include the language the sessions are conducted in, the platform hosting the video calls, or other considerations.  Otherwise, we would be grateful if you could do another one some time in the next few weeks - if you don't have questions about our lessons or workshop operations, you can always bring thoughts or comments on other teaching or training you've done, and how it compares with our approaches.
