Thanks again for taking part in Software Carpentry instructor training --- we're pleased to have you on the team. When you have a minute, please:

1.  Take a moment to update your profile at https://amy.software-carpentry.org/workshops/update_profile/ so we know where you are and what you're comfortable teaching.

2.  Send us a three-line bio and a photo to add to our team page at http://software-carpentry.org/team/.

3.  Make sure you're on the instructors' mailing list at http://software-carpentry.org/join/ so that you'll get notice about upcoming workshops that need instructors. If you'd like us to help you organize one where you are, please let us know.

Please also join the discussion list (same page as the instructors' list): it's low traffic and high signal-to-noise, and it would be great to have your input on what we're doing.

Thanks again!
