- **Accessibility**:
  Equal access to learning opportunities regardless of learners' physical abilities or other attributes.

- **Authentic Task**:
  A task which contains important elements of things that learners would
  do in real life (i.e. non-classroom situations).  To be authentic, a task should
  require learners to construct their own answers rather than choose
  among provided answers, and to work with the same tools and data
  they would use in real life.

- **Chunking**:
  The act of grouping related concepts together so that they can be
  stored and processed as a single unit.

- **Cognitive Load**:
  [Cognitive load][wikipedia-cognitive-load] is the amount of mental
  effort required to solve a problem.  Cognitive load theory divides
  this effort into *intrinsic*, *extraneous*, and *germane*, and holds
  that people learn faster and better when extraneous load is reduced.

- **Community of Practice**:
  A self-perpetuating group of people who share and develop a craft or
  occupation, such as knitters, musicians, or programmers.

- **Competent Practitioner**:
  Someone who can do normal tasks with normal effort under normal
  circumstances.
  <br>
  See also *novice* and *expert*.

- **Concept Map**:
  A picture of a mental model in which concepts are nodes in a graph
  and relationships are (labelled) arcs.

- **Deliberate Practice**:
  The act of observing performance of a task while doing it in order to
  improve ability.

- **Diagnostic Power**:
  The degree to which a wrong answer to a question or exercise tells the
  instructor what misconceptions a particular learner has.

- **Educational Psychology**:
  The study of how people learn.
  <br>

- **Effort-based Praise**:
  Providing positive feedback to learners that recognizes and rewards their hard work.
  <br>
  See also *improvement-based praise* and *performance-based praise*.

- **Error Framing**: Presenting errors as an integral part of the learning process and using them as teaching opportunities.

- **Expert**:
  Someone who can diagnose and handle unusual situations, knows when the
  usual rules do not apply, and tends to recognize solutions rather than
  reasoning to them.
  <br>
  See also *competent practitioner* and *novice*.

- **Expert Awareness Gap**:
  The inability of experts to empathize with novices who are
  encountering concepts or practices for the first time.
  Often referred to as expert blind spot in the literature.

  A series of examples in which a steadily increasing number of key
  steps are blanked out.

  lack of some necessary attribute.
  <br>
  See also *growth mindset*.

- **Fluid Representation**:
  The ability to move quickly between different models of a problem.

- **Formative Assessment**:

- **Jugyokenkyu**:
  See *lesson study*.

- **Lateral Knowledge Transfer**:
  The "accidental" transfer of knowledge that occurs when an instructor
  is teaching one thing, and the learner picks up another.

- **Learner Profile**:
  A brief description of a typical target learner for a lesson that
  includes their general background, what they already know, what they
  want to do, how the lesson will help them, and any special needs they
  might have.

- **Learning Objective**:
  What a lesson is trying to achieve.

- **Lesson Study**:
  The process in which instructors collaboratively plan lessons,
  observe each other's teaching, and discuss teaching experiences
  in order to learn from each other.

- **Live Coding**:
  The act of teaching programming by writing software in front of

- **Long-Term Memory**:
  The part of memory that stores information for long periods of time.

- **Mental Model**:
  A representation of a person's knowledge and thought processes about a topic or domain.

  Someone who has not yet built a usable mental model of a domain.
  <br>
  See also *competent practitioner* and *expert*.
