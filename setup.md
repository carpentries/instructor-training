1.  Please read ["The Science of Learning"]({{ page.training_site }}/files/papers/science-of-learning-2015.pdf), which provides a brief overview of some key evidence-based results in teaching.

2.  Please go to the [Software Carpentry lessons page]({{ site.swc_site }}/lessons/)
    and the [Data Carpentry lessons page]({{ site.dc_site}}/lessons/),
    have a look at what we currently teach,
    and then choose *one* episode from the list at the bottom of this page and read through it carefully.
    You will be using your selected episode for several in-class exercises,
    so be sure you are comfortable with the content.

3.  We will be recording one another teaching in pairs or threes during the class,
    so please bring a cell phone or hand-held camera that can record audio and video.
    It doesn't have to be high-quality, but it should be good enough that you can understand what someone is saying.

4.  Please also bring a laptop powerful enough to teach on so that you can take part in all of the practical exercises
    (a tablet won't be sufficient).


After this course is over,
you will be asked to do three short follow-up exercises online in order to finish qualifying as an instructor:
the details are available on [the checkout checklist]({{ page.training_site }}/checkout/).
If you have any questions about the workshop, the reading material, or anything else, please [get in touch](mailto:checkout@carpentries.org).

If you are interested in doing more reading, we have [some recommendations]( {{ page.training_site }}/reference).
