{: .question}

> ## Faded Examples Exercise
> *   Learner can correctly explain the basis and implications of cognitive load theory
>     and critique it.
> *   Learner can construct faded examples for use as classroom exercises
>     and explain the problem-solving strategies those examples illustrate.
{: .objectives}

1. Talk about battling theories and then 3 different kinds of load (be short but clear).
2. Divide trainees into groups of 4-5
3. Then thrown into the Etherpad the faded example (Python code) included in the Instructor Training materials.
4. Define the audience for these examples. For example, are these beginners who only know some basics programming concepts? Or are these learners with some experience in programming but not in Python? You need to provide this information so that the trainees can decide what intrinsic knowledge these audiences have.
5. Talk the trainees through some examples of intrinsic, germane and extraneous knowledge for the Python faded example for the audiences you defined. For example:
		* *Intrinsic load: ability to read and write; understanding what variable is*
		* *Germane load: learning how to loop through a collection in Python*
		* *Extraneous load: need to know that Python requires indentation*
6. Ask the trainees to discuss and identify in groups what different loads occur, and write them into the Etherpad.



If there are people among the trainees who don't program at all, make sure that they are in separate groups and ask to the groups to work with that person as a learner to help identify different loads. Another option is to have a faded example that is not programming specific. But that may be difficult to achieve.
