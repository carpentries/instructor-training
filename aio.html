<h3 class="callout-title">Pronouns and Names</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Using correct names and pronouns (e.g. “she/her”) is important for
setting a respectful tone. Learning these is hard to do quickly, so we
recommend displaying it prominently during the training.</p>
<p>In an online training, give everyone a moment to update their display
name to reflect how they would like to be addressed.</p>
<p>At an in-person event, we recommend supplying name tags and markers,
or using plain paper to create table-displayed name placards.</p>
<p>Note that pronouns are personal and some participants might prefer
not to share them. Do not force people to share their pronouns. One
reason to avoid pressuring people to share them is to allow people to
share their gender identity only when they feel ready to. It is,
however, necessary for all participants to use pronouns and names as
listed when participants provide them.</p>

official Lesson Programs of The Carpentries. The Carpentries is a

<li>Library Carpentry focuses on teaching data skills to people working

that will enable researchers to be more productive and do better
research.</p>

<p>The goal of this training is to provide you with the skills and
information you need to become a certified Carpentries Instructor. Our
expectations of certified Instructors is that they:</p>
<ul>
<li>be familiar with and understand <strong>how to apply research-based
teaching principles</strong>, especially as they apply to The
Carpentries audience.</li>
<li>understand the <strong>importance of a respectful and inclusive
classroom environment</strong>; commit to creating such an environment;
and be able to identify and implement The Carpentries policies and
general practices to accomplish this.</li>
<li>
<strong>practice and develop skills</strong> in the teaching methods
used in The Carpentries workshops.</li>
<li>learn enough about The Carpentries organisation to <strong>know
where to go for help</strong>, how to start organizing a workshop, and
how to get involved with community activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>These four goals are broken down into four main themes of
content:</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="how-learning-works">How Learning Works<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#how-learning-works"></a>
</h3>
<p>One of our main emphases will be discussing the <strong>best
practices</strong> of teaching. We will be introducing you to a handful
of key educational research findings and demonstrating how they can be
used to help people learn better and faster.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="building-teaching-skill">Building Teaching Skill<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#building-teaching-skill"></a>
</h3>
<p>Just like learning a new language, a musical instrument, or a sport,
teaching is a skill that requires practice and feedback. We will have
many opportunities to practice and give each other feedback throughout
this training.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="creating-a-positive-learning-environment">Creating a Positive Learning Environment<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#creating-a-positive-learning-environment"></a>

<p>One part of making this a productive experience for all of us is a
community effort to treat one another with kindness and respect. The <a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/policies/coc/" class="external-link">Code of Conduct</a> is
one piece of this. We will also be discussing and practicing teaching
techniques to create a positive and welcoming environment in your
classrooms, and will spend some time talking about why this is
important.</p>

<h3 id="the-carpentries-history-and-culture">The Carpentries History and Culture<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-carpentries-history-and-culture"></a>
</h3>
<p>In addition to the teaching practices and philosophy that have been
adopted by The Carpentries community, it is helpful to become familiar
with our community structure and organisational procedures as you
prepare to join our Instructor community. The greatest asset of The
Carpentries is people like you - people who want to help researchers
learn new skills and share their own experience and enthusiasm. Meeting
your fellow trainees and Instructor Trainers at this event is your first
step into The Carpentries community.</p>

<p>We will <strong>not</strong> be going over Data Carpentry, Library
Carpentry, or Software Carpentry workshop content in detail (although
you will gain familiarity with some of the content through the
exercises), This training is a significant requirement for becoming a
certified Carpentries Instructor. The additional steps for
certification, called <em>Checkout</em>, will require that you dig into
the workshop content yourself. We will talk about checkout requirements
more in part 3 of this training.</p>
<p>We also do not discuss <em>how</em> to develop lessons, although we
do mention some aspects of lesson design. We include this information to
help you as an instructor identify the important components of lessons
for high impact, inclusive teaching. The Carpentries now has a growing
subcommunity dedicated to lesson development, and offers <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-development-training/index.html" class="external-link">additional
training in lesson development</a>.</p>

<p>We hope and expect that you will have many questions during this
training! Please do not keep them to yourself. If you find something
unclear, chances are good that others will have the same question, too.
It is ok to ask even if you think you might have missed an answer

Depending on the time available, your Trainers may ask you to share your
questions verbally, in the Etherpad, or otherwise.</p>
<p>Now that we have a road map of what we are covering we are ready to

<p>We will now get started with a discussion of how learning works. We
will begin with some key concepts from educational research and identify
how these principles are put into practice in Carpentries workshops.</p>
<section><h2 class="section-heading" id="the-carpentries-pedagogical-model">The Carpentries Pedagogical Model<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-carpentries-pedagogical-model"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>The Carpentries aims to teach computational competence to learners.
We take an applied approach, avoiding the theoretical and general in
favour of the practical and specific. By showing learners how to solve
specific problems with specific tools and providing hands-on practice,
we develop learners’ confidence and lay the foundation for future
learning.</p>
<p>A critical component of this process is that learners are able to
practice what they are learning in real time, get feedback on what they
are doing, and then apply those lessons learned to the next step in the
learning process. Having learners help each other during the workshops
also helps to reinforce concepts taught during the workshops.</p>
<p><strong>A Carpentries workshop is an interactive event</strong> – for
learners and instructors. We give and receive feedback throughout the
course of a workshop. We incorporate assessments within the lesson
materials and ask for feedback on sticky notes during lunch breaks and
at the end of each day.</p>
<p>One reason why practice and feedback are so important is because a
Carpentries workshop is not simply a source of information: It is the
starting point for development of a new skill. To understand what this
means, we will start by exploring what research tells us about skill
acquisition and development of a “mental model.”</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="the-acquisition-of-skill">The Acquisition of Skill<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-acquisition-of-skill"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Our approach is based on the work of researchers like Patricia
Benner, who applied the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition" class="external-link">Dreyfus
model of skill acquisition</a> in her studies of <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0270467604265061" class="external-link">how
nurses progress from novice to expert</a> (<a href="https://www.worldcat.org/search?q=au%3ABenner%2C+Patricia+E." class="external-link">see
also books by Benner</a>). This work indicates that through practice and
formal instruction, learners acquire skills and advance through distinct
stages. In simplified form, three stages of this model are:</p>
<figure><img src="fig/skill-level.svg" alt='Three people, labeled from left to right as "Novice", "Competent Practitioner", and "Expert". Underneath,an arrow labelled "Experience level" points from left to right. The "Novice" is quoted, "I am not sure what questions to ask." The Competent Practitioner is quoted, "I am pretty confident, but I still look stuff up a lot!" The Expert is quoted "I have been doing this on a daily basis for years!"' class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><ul>
<li>
<p><em>Novice</em>: someone who does not know what they do not know,
i.e., they do not yet know what the key ideas in the domain are or how
they relate. Novices may have difficulty formulating questions, or may
ask questions that seem irrelevant or off-topic as they rely on prior
knowledge, without knowing what is or is not related yet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: A <em>novice</em> learner in a Carpentries workshop might
never have heard of the bash shell, and therefore may have no
understanding of how it relates to their file system or other programs
on their computer.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Competent practitioner</em>: someone who has enough
understanding for everyday purposes. They will not know all the details
of how something works and their understanding may not be entirely
accurate, but it is sufficient for completing normal tasks with normal
effort under normal circumstances.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: A <em>competent practitioner</em> in a Carpentries workshop
might have used the shell before and understand how to move around
directories and use individual programs, but they might not understand
how they can fit these programs together to build scripts and automate
large tasks.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Expert</em>: someone who can easily handle situations that
are out of the ordinary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: An <em>expert</em> in a Carpentries workshop may have
experience writing and running shell scripts and, when presented with a
problem, immediately sees how these skills can be used to solve the
problem.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that how a person <em>feels</em> about their skill level is not
included in these definitions! You may or may not consider yourself an
expert in a particular subject, but may nonetheless function at that
level in certain contexts. We will come back to the expertise of the
Instructor and its impact – positive and negative – on teaching, in the
next episode. For now, we are primarily concerned with novices, as this
is The Carpentries’ primary target audience.</p>
<p>It is common to think of a novice as a sort of an “empty vessel” into
which knowledge can be “poured.” Unfortunately, this analogy includes
inaccuracies that can generate dangerous misconceptions. In our next
section, we will briefly explore the nature of “knowledge” through a
concept that helps us differentiate between novices and competent
practitioners in a more useful and visual way. This, in turn, will have
implications for how we teach.</p>

<p>Understanding is never a mirror of reality, even for an expert;
rather, it is an internal representation based on our experience with a
subject. This internal representation is often described as a
<strong>mental model</strong>. A mental model allows us to extrapolate,
or make predictions beyond and between the narrow limits of experience
and memory, filling in gaps to the point that things “make sense.”</p>
<p>As we learn, our mental model evolves to become more complex and,
most importantly, more useful. A useful model makes reasonable
predictions and fits well within the range of things we are likely to
encounter. While there will always be inaccuracies – or “misconceptions”
– these do not interfere with day-to-day functioning. A useful model
does not seize up or break down entirely as new concepts are added.</p>

<h3 id="the-power-and-limitations-of-analogies">The power (and limitations) of analogies<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-power-and-limitations-of-analogies"></a>
</h3>
<p>Some mental models can be succinctly summarised by comparison to
something else that is more universally understood. Good analogies can
be extraordinarily useful when teaching, because they draw upon an
existing mental model to fill in another, speeding learning and making a
memorable connection. However, all analogies have limitations! If you
choose to use an analogy, be sure its usefulness outweighs its potential
to generate misconceptions that may interfere with learning.</p>

<p>People often ask where our name came from. Greg Wilson has this to
say:</p>
<p>“Brent Gorda and I came up with the name in 1998 to differentiate
what we were teaching from software engineering. That’s about digging
the Channel Tunnel; we’re about the computational equivalent of hanging
drywall.”</p>
<p>The word “carpentry” acts as a metaphor – a type of analogy –
inspiring a comparison with something concrete, hands on, practical, and
useful. This clearly conveys the purpose of our organisation: to support
computational skill development among working practitioners who need the
right tools and practices to be effective day to day.</p>

<p>A mental model may be represented as a collection of concepts and
facts, connected by relationships. The mental model of an expert in any
given subject will be far larger and more complex than that of a novice,
including both more concepts and more detailed and numerous
relationships. However, <strong>both may be perfectly useful</strong> in
certain contexts.</p>
<p>Returning to our example levels of skill development:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em>novice</em> has a minimal mental model of surface features of
the domain. Inaccuracies based on limited prior knowledge may interfere
with adding new information. Predictions are likely to borrow heavily
from mental models of other domains which seem superficially
similar.</li>
<li>A <em>competent practitioner</em> has a mental model that is useful
for everyday purposes. Most new information they are likely to encounter
will fit well with their existing model. Even though many potential
elements of their mental model may still be missing or wrong,
predictions about their area of work are usually accurate.</li>
<li>An <em>expert</em> has a densely populated and connected mental
model that is especially good for problem solving. They quickly connect
concepts that others may not see as being related. They may have
difficulty explaining how they are thinking in ways that do not rely on
other features unique to their own mental model.</li>

</h3>

<p>Most people do not naturally visualise a mental model as a diagram of
concepts and relationships. Mental models are complicated! Yet, visual
representation of concepts and relationships can be a useful way to
explore and understand hidden features of a mental model.</p>
<p>There are certain ways in which you may routinely use visual
organisers, such as flow charts or biochemical pathway diagrams. A more
general tool that is useful for exploring any network of concepts and
relationships is a <strong>concept map</strong>. Pioneered for classroom
use by John Novak in the 1970s, a concept map asks you to identify which
concepts are most relevant to a topic at hand and – critically – to
identify how they are connected. It can be quite difficult to identify
and organise these connections! However, the process of forcing abstract
knowledge into a visual format can force you to name connections that
you might otherwise have quietly assumed, or illuminate gaps that you
may not have been aware of. Especially where analogies are not
available, concept mapping can help you to make your mental model of a
concept more clear to yourself or others.</p>
<p>As an example, consider a mental model of the relationship between a
small ball and water in a full glass.</p>
<p>The concept map below illustrates a simple mental model that a young
child might develop after putting the ball in the water.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/ballwater1a.svg" alt='Two words inside rectangles, with labeled arrows connecting them. "Ball" is at the left, with an arrow pointing to "Water", at right, labeled as "Pushes out."' class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>Give a child balls of three different sizes, and they might put
together a somewhat more complex mental model, perhaps illustrated
as:</p>

<p>The mental model above connects a ball to the water it can displace,
recognizing that ‘more’ ball can move ‘more’ water. This mental model is
perfectly functional for a child who wants to have fun splashing water
around. It may endure in this way for several years of beaches and
bathtubs.</p>
<p>However, when this child is asked to predict what would happen to the
water if a ball were not bigger or smaller but <em>heavier</em> or
<em>lighter</em>, they will naturally apply their existing mental model
to the task. BUT…</p>
<figure><img src="fig/ballwater3a.svg" alt='A concept map similar to the previous one except with "Heavy Ball" and "Light Ball" in the middle, and a red "X" over the arrows labeled "Pushes out MORE" and "Pushes out LESS"' class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>What a surprise! The challenge presented by this new information is
that it clashes with the pre-existing mental model, to which it seemed
to apply. This prior knowledge needs to be adjusted to a new
understanding that incorporates the difference between properties of
mass and volume.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/ballwater4a.svg" alt='A new concept map. "Ball" remains at left, and "Water", at right. "Size" and "Weight" are stacked vertically between them. Arrows from "Ball" share the label "Can have more or less." One arrow from "size to "water" is labeled "Affects pushing of"' class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>When mental models break, learning can occur more slowly than you
might expect. The longer a prior model was in use, and the more
extensively it has to be <em>unlearned</em>, the more it can actively
interfere with the incorporation of new knowledge. Our child may quickly
adapt to this new information if they had never thought much about mass
before and were simply trying out an existing mental model on a new
situation. However, if they had extensive experience with balls that
were both larger and heavier (for example), it may take longer to
unlearn what they thought they understood about mass.</p>
<p>Most mental models worth mapping are not so simple. Yet, forcing
complex ideas in to this simplified format can be useful when preparing
to teach, because it forces you to be explicit about exactly what
concepts are at the heart of your topic, and to name relationships
between them.</p>

</h3>
<p>Correcting learners’ misconceptions is at least as important as
presenting them with correct information. There are many ways of
classifying different types of misconceptions. For our purposes, it is
useful to consider 3 broad categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple <em>factual errors</em>. These exist in isolation from any
deeper understanding. These are the easiest to correct. Example:
believing that Vancouver is the capital of British Columbia.</li>
<li>
<em>Broken models</em>. These occur when inaccuracies explain
relationships and generate predictions (often successfully!) in an
existing mental model. These take time to address, demanding that
learners reason carefully through examples to see contradictions.
Examples: believing that motion and acceleration must always be in the
same direction, or that seasons are related to the shape of the earth’s
orbit.</li>
<li>
<em>Fundamental beliefs</em>, which are deeply connected to a
learner’s social identity and are the hardest to change. Examples: “the
world is only a few thousand years old” or “human beings cannot affect
the planet’s climate”. “I am not a computational person” may, arguably,
also fall into this category of misconception.</li>
</ul>
<p>The middle category of misconceptions is the most useful type to
watch out for in Carpentries workshops. While teaching, we want to
expose learners’ broken models so that we can help them begin to
deconstruct them and build better ones in their place.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>In order to effectively root out pre-existing misconceptions that
need to be un-learned and stop quietly developing misconceptions in
their tracks, an Instructor needs to be actively and persistently
looking for them. But how?</p>
<p>Like so many challenges we will discuss in this training, the answer
is <strong>feedback</strong>. In this case, we want feedback that allows
us to <strong>assess</strong> the developing mental model of a trainee
in highly specific ways, to verify that learning is proceeding according
to plan and not careening off in some unpredicted direction. We want to
get this feedback <strong>while we teach</strong> so that we can respond
to that information and adapt our instruction to get learners back on
track.</p>
<p>This kind of assessment has a name: it is called <strong>formative
assessment</strong> because it is applied during learning to form the
practice of teaching and the experience of the learner. This is
different from exams, for example, which sum up what a participant has
learned but are not used to guide further progress and are hence called
<strong>summative</strong>.</p>
<p>Feedback from formative assessment illuminates misconceptions for
both Instructors and learners. It also provides reassurance on both
sides when learning <em>is</em> proceeding on track! It is far more
reliable than reading faces or using feelings of comfort as a metric,
which tends to be what Instructors and learners default to
otherwise.</p>

<p>Formative assessments can serve many purposes other than hunting down
misconceptions, such as verifying engagement or supporting memory
consolidation. We will discuss some of these functions in later
episodes. In this section, we are interested quite narrowly in
evaluating mental models.</p>
<p>One example of formative assessment that can be used to tease out
misconceptions is the multiple choice question (MCQ). When designed
carefully, these can target anticipated misconceptions with surgical
precision. For example, suppose we are teaching children multi-digit
addition. A well-designed MCQ would be:</p>
<pre class="source"><code>Q: what is 27 + 15 ?
a) 42
b) 32
c) 312
d) 33</code></pre>
<p>The correct answer is 42, but each of the other answers provides
valuable insight.</p>

<p>Designing a few MCQs with diagnostic power is useful when preparing
to teach even if they are never used, for the same reason that concept
mapping can be useful: it forces the instructor to think about the
learners’ mental models and try to anticipate how they might be broken.
In short, it helps Instructors to put themselves into the learners’
heads and see the topic from their point of view. We will talk more
about the process of preparing to teach in a later episode.</p>

<p>It takes work to actively assess mental models throughout a workshop;
this also takes time. This can make Instructors feel conflicted about
using formative assessment routinely. However, the need to conduct
routine assessment is not the only reason why a workshop <strong>should
proceed more slowly than you think</strong>.</p>
<p>One key insight from research on cognitive development is that
novices, competent practitioners, and experts each need to be taught
differently. In particular, presenting novices with a pile of facts
early on is counter-productive, because they do not yet have a model or
framework to fit those facts into. In fact, <strong>presenting too many
facts too soon can actually reinforce an incorrect mental
model</strong>. (This is a key problem with the “empty vessel” analogy
described earlier.)</p>
<p>Most learners coming to Carpentries lessons are novices, and do not
have a strong mental model of the concepts we are teaching. Thus, our
primary goal is <strong>not</strong> to teach the syntax of a particular
programming language, but <strong>to help them construct a working
mental model</strong> so that they have something to attach facts to. In
other words, our goal is to teach people <strong>how to think</strong>
about programming and data management in a way that will allow them to
learn more easily on their own or understand what they might find
online.</p>

<p>If someone feels it is too slow, they will be a bit bored. If they
feel it is too fast, they will never come back to programming. — Kunal

<p>If our goal is to help novices construct an accurate and useful
mental model of a new intellectual domain, this will impact our
teaching. For example, we principally want to help learners form the
right categories and make connections among concepts. We <em>do not</em>
want to overload them with a slew of unrelated facts, as this will be
confusing.</p>
<p>An important practical implication of this latter point is the pace
at which we teach.<br>
In the first main episode of Software Carpentry’s <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/" class="external-link">lesson on the Unix
shell</a>, which covers “Navigating Files and Directories”, there are
only four “commands” for 40 minutes of teaching. Ten minutes per command
may seem glacially slow, but that episodes’s real purpose is to teach
learners about paths; later on, they will learn about history,
wildcards, pipes and filters, command-line arguments, redirection, and
all the other big ideas on which the shell depends, and without which
people cannot understand how to use commands.</p>
<p>That mental model of the shell also includes things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anything you repeat manually, you will eventually get wrong (so let
the computer repeat things for you by using tab completion and the
<code>history</code> command).</li>
<li>Lots of little tools, combined as needed, are more productive than a
handful of programs. (This motivates the pipe-and-filter model.)</li>
</ul>
<p>These two examples illustrate something else as well. Learning
consists of more than “just” adding information to mental models;
creating linkages between concepts and facts is at least as important.
Telling people that they should not repeat things, and that they should
try to think (by analogy) in terms of little pieces loosely joined, both
set the stage for discussing functions. Explicitly referring back to
pipes and filters in the shell when introducing functions helps solidify
both ideas.</p>

<p>In the last episode, we discussed the transition from novice to
competent practitioner through formation of a functional mental model.
We now shift our attention to experts. The expert we want to talk about
is you!</p>
<p>Even if you do not yet think of yourself as an expert, you may
nonetheless have advanced to the point where some of these key
characteristics – and potential pitfalls – apply to you. We will discuss
what distinguishes expertise from novices/competent practitioners, how
being an expert can make it more difficult to teach novices, and some
tools to help instructors identify and overcome these difficulties.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>An <a href="02-practice-learning">earlier topic</a> described a key
difference between novices and competent practitioners. Novices lack a
mental model, or have only a very incomplete model with limited utility.
Competent practitioners have mental models that work well enough for
most situations. How are experts different from both of these
groups?</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>What is something that you are an expert in? How does your experience
when you are acting as an expert differ from when you are not an
expert?</p>
<p>This discussion should take about 5 minutes.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In reviewing the answers to the question above you will find that the
expert experience amounts to much more than just knowing more facts.
Competent practitioners can memorise a lot of information without any
noticeable improvement to their performance. So, what makes an expert?
The answer is that experts have <strong>more connections among pieces of
knowledge</strong> that help them think and problem-solve quickly; more
“short-cuts”, if you will.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/mental_models.svg" alt='Three collections of six circles. The first collection is labelled "Novice" and has only two arrows connecting some of the circles. The second collection, labelled "Competent Practitioner" has six connecting arrows. The third collection, labelled "Expert", is densely connected, with eight connecting arrows.' class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>This brings us back to our mental model diagrams, where facts are
nodes and relationships are arcs. The greater connectivity of a mental
model allows experts to:</p>
<ul>
<li>see connections between two topics or ideas that no one else can
see</li>
<li>see a single problem in several different ways</li>
<li>know how to solve a problem, or “what questions to ask”</li>
<li>jump directly from a problem to its solution because there is a
direct link between the two in their mind. Where a competent
practitioner would have to reason “A therefore B therefore C therefore
F”, the expert can go from A to F in a single step (“A therefore
F”).</li>
</ul>
<p>We will expand on some of these below and how they can manifest in
the way you teach.</p>

<p>Because your learners’ mental models will likely be less densely
connected than your own, a conclusion that seems obvious to you will not
seem that way to your learners. It is important to explain what you are
doing step-by-step, and how each step leads to the next one.</p>

<h3 id="mind-the-gap">Mind The Gap<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#mind-the-gap"></a>
</h3>
<p>The problem with this is that when you are used to going from A to F
in a single leap, it can be very hard to remember that novices need to
go through steps B and C before they can understand the connection
between A and F. Experts are frequently so familiar with their subject
that they can no longer imagine what it is like to <em>not</em>
understand the world that way. This phenomenon is known in the
literature as an <em>expert blind spot</em>.</p>

</div>
<div id="expert-awareness-gap" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">Expert Awareness Gap</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>In The Carpentries, we aim to create an inclusive environment. We
prefer to refer to this phenomenon as the <em>expert awareness gap</em>
to be consistent with our objective to use inclusive language. It can be
exclusionary to use a term that relates to a disability for other
purposes. We introduce both terms, however, to help you as future
instructors engage with these ideas in the literature and with people
outside of The Carpentries community.</p>
<p>In evaluating potential terms, one instructor provided the following
thoughts:</p>
<p>I like expert awareness gap because it is more precise than blind
spot (it is not about seeing, but about noticing) and feels more of a
surmountable challenge than a disadvantage. To me a disadvantage can
sometimes feel like a thing that exists as a fact, like an inevitable
consequence, but a gap is a thing to be bridged– and we certainly want
instructors to try to overcome (or mitigate) their expert awareness
gap</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Awareness gaps can lead to some interesting reversals in the
classroom. While deep expertise in a subject area can be valuable when
teaching, it can also create obstacles that must be overcome with
practice. People with less expertise, who still remember what it is like
to have to learn the things, can be better equipped to anticipate novice
misconceptions compared with an expert who has not learned to identify
their awareness gaps.</p>
<p>What does this mean for you? If you have deep expertise in the
subject you are hoping to teach, listen carefully to your learners, and
seek out less-expert colleagues to discuss your teaching plans. If, on
the other hand, you still feel new to your subject area – perhaps you
even feel a little tentative about whether you are “expert enough” to
teach – take heart! Your explanations may be more likely to meet novice
learners where they are.</p>

<h3 id="switching-language">Switching Language<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#switching-language"></a>
</h3>
<p>If you worked in the USA in the same building as something called a
“delicatessen”, you might invite a friend to meet you at “the deli” or
simply at “the restaurant” and expect them to know what you mean,
because you naturally use these terms interchangeably. Yet, someone less
familiar with US English might hesitate, wondering if these words mean
the same thing, or close enough, under the circumstances. Similarly, in
a Carpentries workshop, an Instructor may start a workshop talking about
“Unix”, but then automatically start using words like “Bash” and “shell”
without noticing that learners are struggling to figure out how these
two new words are related.</p>
<p>Novice learners can be confused by interchangeable use of more than
just vocabulary. In programming, multiple forms of notation may be used
to reference a column in a data frame, for example, with the same
effect. Instructors may use absolute file paths in one place, then
default to relative file paths elsewhere without noticing that
explanation is required. Or, they may assume that a learner who has an
absolute file path will be able to navigate to the file in a GUI.</p>

<p>Experts are also better at diagnosing errors than novices or

an expert will often automatically diagnose and solve a problem before a
novice has even finished reading the error message. Because of this, it
is very important while teaching to be explicit about the process you
are using to engage with errors, even if they seem trivial to you, as
they often will.</p>

recognise one <em>ineffective</em> strategy often deployed by experts

is.</em> This often manifests in using the word “just” in explanations,
as in, “Look, it is easy, you just… (<em>wave magic wand with
undecipherable incantations</em>)” This language gives learners the very
clear signal that the person helping them thinks their problem is
trivial and that there must be something wrong with them if they do not
experience it that way.</p>

dismiss learner confusion by asking for questions in a way that reveals
that <em>they do not actually expect that anyone will have them</em>.
Asking, “Does anyone have any questions?” implies that most people will
not; the shorter the wait time before moving on, the more this
implication is magnified. Instead, consider asking “What questions do
you have?” and leaving a healthy pause for consideration. This firmly
establishes an expectation that people will, indeed, have questions, and
should challenge themselves to formulate them.</p>

<p>As you seek to re-acquaint yourself with the novice experience, it
can be tempting to think back to your own experiences getting started in
programming. Trips down memory lane can be productive! However, it is
important that you take care not to generalise from your experience to
that of your novice learners.</p>
<p>We will talk more about knowing your audience in a later episode. For
now, here are two points to keep in mind when contemplating the learner
experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>In most cases a researcher’s <strong>primary goal is not to learn
programming</strong>, but to do better and more efficient research. They
may not wish to take the time to learn how fundamental syntax or data
structures work, or to learn any ‘fun facts’ that are not strictly
necessary; they just want to know how to get their work done. This does
not mean they never will be interested – maybe this is how you got your
start, too! But if you began with an interest in programming, keep in
mind that this can make their learning experience very different from
yours.</li>
<li>Some researchers have avoided learning programming previously
because they believe that the time investment will be excessive and will
interfere with their other work. These kinds of beliefs can make their
motivation to persevere more fragile than yours might have been when you
got started.</li>

meaningful connections, to confidently turn an error into a learning
opportunity, or to explain a complex topic in multiple ways. Experts can

<section><h2 class="section-heading" id="types-of-memory">Types of Memory<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#types-of-memory"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Learning involves memory. For our purposes, human memory can be
divided into two different layers. The first is called
<strong>long-term</strong>. It is where we store persistent information
like our friends’ names and our home address. It is essentially
unbounded (barring injury or disease, we will die before it fills up)
but it is slow to access.</p>
<p>Our second layer of memory is called <strong>short-term</strong>.
This is the type of memory you use to actively think about things and is
often called working memory. It is much faster, but also much smaller:
in 1956, George Miller estimated that the average adult’s short-term
memory could hold <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two" class="external-link">7±2
items</a></strong> for a few seconds before things started to drop out.
This is why phone numbers are typically 7 or 8 digits long: back when
phones had dials instead of keypads, that was the longest sequence of
numbers most adults could remember accurately for as long as it took the
dial to go around and around.</p>
<p>More recent research suggests that short-term memory is actually even
smaller than this. Regardless of its exact size, which may differ across
people and contexts, we know that short-term memory is limited. This has
important implications for teaching. If we present our learners with
large amounts of information, without giving them the opportunity to
practice using it (and thereby transfer it into long-term memory), they
will not retain the material as well as if we present small amounts of
information interspersed with practice opportunities. This is yet
another reason why going slowly and using frequent formative assessment
is important.</p>

<p>Most people will have found they only remember 5-7 words. Those who
remember less may be experiencing distraction, fatigue, or (as we will
learn shortly) “cognitive overload.” Those who remember more are almost
invariably deploying a <em>memory management strategy</em>.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Because short-term memory is limited, we can support learners by not
flooding their short term memory with too many separate pieces of
information. Does this mean we should teach fewer concepts? Yes!
However, this is not the only tool in our toolbox. We can also assist by
providing strategies and exercises to help them form the connections
that will a) support them in holding more things in short-term memory at
once and b) begin to <strong>consolidate</strong> some concepts, moving
them into long-term memory.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="chunking">Chunking<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#chunking"></a>
</h3>
<p>Our minds can store larger numbers of facts in short-term memory by
creating <em>chunks</em>, or relationships among separate items,
allowing them to be remembered as a single item. For example, most of us
will remember a word we read as a single item (“cat”), rather than as a
sequence of letters (“c-a-t”). Similarly, the pattern made by five spots
on cards or die is remembered as a whole rather than as five separate
pieces of information.</p>

short-term memory, allowing you to keep more information in your head at

<p>You may have come across other mnemonic strategies, including some
that rely on imagining a “place” association for each item, e.g. a
“memory palace.” While slightly different from chunking, this is another
example of how <strong>connecting information can make it easier to
remember</strong>.</p>

</h3>
<p>Formative assessment is a key component in helping learners solidify
their understanding and begin transferring ideas into long-term memory.
Why? Because it engages the brain in retrieving recently-learned
information and actively applying it to solve a problem. This helps to
both reinforce and connect that new information in useful ways.</p>
<p>The limitations of short-term memory are one reason why
<strong>assessments should be frequent</strong>: short-term memory is
limited not only in space, but also in time. If you wait too long before
deploying a formative assessment, some of the information necessary to
complete the task will already be forgotten. This time window can be
very short, especially if a lot of content is being taught at once! Be
sure to remind learners about prior concepts essential to a task. When
you no longer need to remind them, this is a sign that your efforts in
supporting memory consolidation have worked!</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="group-work">Group Work<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#group-work"></a>
</h3>
<p><strong>Elaboration</strong>, or explaining your work, supports
transfer to long-term memory. This is one reason why <strong>teaching is
one of the most effective ways to learn</strong>! Group work can feel
uncomfortable at first and consumes time in a workshop, but learners
often rate group work as a high point for both enjoyment and learning in
a workshop. This is also a great opportunity for helpers to circulate
and address lingering questions or engage with more advanced
discussions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="opportunities-for-reflection">Opportunities for Reflection<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#opportunities-for-reflection"></a>
</h3>
<p>Reflection is another tool that can help learners review things they
have learned, strengthen connections between them, and consolidate
long-term memories. Like formative assessment, <strong>asking learners
for feedback can double as both a source of information and an effective
consolidating prompt</strong>, as providing feedback demands some
reflection on what has been learned. We will talk more about methods for
this in the next section. You may also wish to pause and allow learners
to write summary notes for themselves or otherwise ask them to review
what they have learned at various points in the workshop.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="limit-concepts">Limit concepts<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#limit-concepts"></a>
</h3>
<p>In the same vein as “going slowly,” it is important to limit the
number of concepts introduced in a lesson. This can be hard! As you are
reviewing a lesson to teach, you will doubtless come across related
concepts that are very useful, and you may feel strongly motivated to
sneak them in. Planning your lesson with a concept map can help you not
only identify key concepts and relationships, but also to notice when
you are trying to teach too many things at once.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Memory is not the only cognitive resource that is limited. Attention
is constrained as well, which can limit the information that enters
short term memory in the first place as well as interfere with attempts
at consolidation. While many people believe that they can “multi-task,”
the reality is that attention can only focus on one thing at a time.
Adding items that demand attention adds more things to alternate between
attending to, which can reduce efficiency and performance on all of
them.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="the-theory-of-cognitive-load">The Theory of Cognitive Load<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-theory-of-cognitive-load"></a>
</h3>
<p>There are different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load" class="external-link">theories of
cognitive load</a>. In one of these, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1207/s15516709cog1202_4" class="external-link">Sweller</a> posits
that people have to attend to three types of things when they are
learning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Things they have to think about in order to <strong>perform a
task</strong> (“intrinsic”).</li>
<li>Mental effort required to <strong>connect the task</strong> to new
and old information (“germane”).</li>
<li>
<strong>Distractions</strong> and other mental effort not directly
related to performing or learning from the task (“extraneous”).</li>
</ul>
<p>Cognitive load is not always a bad thing! There is plenty of evidence
that <em>some</em> difficulty is desirable and can increase learning.
However, there are limits. Managing all forms of cognitive load, with
particular attention to extraneous load, can help prevent
<strong>cognitive overload</strong> from impeding learning
altogether.</p>
<p>One way to manage cognitive load as tasks become more complex is by
using <strong>guided practice</strong>: creating a structure that
narrowly guides focus on specific skills and knowledge in a stepped
fashion, with feedback at each step before transferring attention to a
new feature.</p>

<div id="is-guided-practice-hand-holding" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">Is Guided Practice “Hand Holding?”</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>An alternative to guided practice is a <em>minimal guidance</em>
approach, where learners are given raw materials (for example a text or
reference) and asked to explore and learn to solve problems on their
own. Minimal guidance is commonly found in many instructional strategies
you may have encountered, variously known as <em>constructivist</em>,
<em>discovery</em>, <em>problem-based</em>, <em>experiential</em> or
<em>inquiry-based</em> learning.</p>
<p>These strategies are not without merit! Indeed, they can work
exceptionally well with advanced learners. However, they frequently fall
flat, especially with novice audiences. A landmark paper by <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1207/s15326985ep4102_1" class="external-link">Kirshner
et al.</a> responds to the popularity and uneven success of minimal
guidance, applying cognitive load theory to understand why these
strategies often fail.</p>
<p>Some people feel concerned that guided practice amounts to
“hand-holding,” implying that learners who receive support may never
learn to function independently. This view fails to account for the
<em>additional cognitive load</em> experienced by novices creating new
connections while learning a task. <strong>Minimally-guided instruction
requires learners to simultaneously master a domain’s factual content
AND its search and problem-solving strategies.</strong> Fostering
creativity and independence takes time. Minimal guidance is intuitively
appealing, but that does not mean it always works.</p>

are intended to be completed together, through participatory live coding
(a technique we will discuss in more detail later in this training).</p>
<p>The choices you make as an Instructor may add to or subtract from
your learners’ cognitive load. Supporting memory consolidation can
reduce load later on in the workshop, as it reduces the effort of
recalling forgotten material. You can also minimise cognitive load by
choosing formative assessments that are narrowly focused and by
considering potential distractions in what you display during
instruction.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="using-formative-assessments-for-memory-management">Using Formative Assessments for Memory Management<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#using-formative-assessments-for-memory-management"></a>
</h3>
<p>There are many different types of exercises that can focus attention
narrowly and help to avoid cognitive overload. Carefully targeted
multiple choice questions can play this role. A few more that you may
wish to consider are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worked-example_effect" class="external-link">Faded
examples</a>: worked examples with targeted details “faded” out –

<li>Labelling diagrams or flow charts (may also be organised as a

</ul>
<p>Beware of assessments that are too open-ended, as these are very
likely to induce cognitive overload in novice learners! You may have
experienced some overload already when you were asked to create a
concept map; this is why we do not recommend these as an activity for
novice learners. Questions that ask learners to both remember and
synthesise or reason with new information are also risky. If you try out
a question and get a room filled with silence, you may need an
icebreaker, you may need to re-teach… or you may only need a more
narrowly focused question.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="what-to-display">What to Display<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-to-display"></a>
</h3>
<p>The Carpentries provides nicely formatted curricula for teaching.
However, you may have noticed that you have not seen much, or perhaps
any of the Instructor Training curriculum during your time as a learner
in this training. In most situations <strong>we do not recommend
displaying Carpentries curriculum materials</strong> to your learners
while you teach.</p>
<p>The visual environment in a workshop should be focused on exactly
what you are teaching and should mirror, as closely as possible, exactly
what you say. This is because keeping track of distracting and
contradictory sensory information adds to cognitive load. The <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_attention_effect" class="external-link">split-attention
effect</a></strong> describes the cognitive effort involved with trying
to assemble information from different modalities. Learning is most
effective when visual displays, text, and auditory information presented
together are the same, with minimal distractions.</p>
<p>For Carpentries workshops, this is why we ask Instructors to
<strong>speak commands as they type them on the screen</strong> while
engaging learners in <a href="17-live">participatory live
coding</a>.</p>
<p>One thing you may wish to consider adding to your (otherwise
minimalist) visual environment, however, is a <strong>running glossary
of commands</strong> and other key terms. This can be maintained by a
helper on a white board or an easel pad and will help learners readily
access items that may have already been dropped from short-term memory
by the time they need them. In an online workshop, display of a glossary
is impractical because of severe limitations on screen space; however, a
glossary can still be maintained in a collaborative document for
reference as needed.</p>

</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="summary">Summary<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#summary"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>The process of learning is constrained by the limits of short-term
memory. In order to move new information into long-term memory, it must
be actively applied, but activities that make excessive demands on
short-term memory are likely to induce cognitive overload and can easily
harm learner motivation. Instructional tools that expand short-term
memory by increasing connectivity (chunking) among new concepts can
improve outcomes for subsequent memory-intensive exercises. Formative
assessments, when performed frequently, help learners by prompting them
to apply new content before it has been overwritten. Faded examples or
other types of guided practice both minimise demands on short-term
memory and offer context that helps improve connectivity for future
work, in which the “scaffolding” of contextual support can be gradually
removed. Anything you can do to a) recognise and b) support learners in
working with the limitations of short-term memory will improve the
effectiveness of your teaching.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Before each long break, for example lunch or between days, we have
learners complete <strong>minute cards</strong> to share anonymous
feedback. At an in-person workshop, paper sticky notes double as minute
cards, with the two different colours used for positive and constructive
feedback. At an online workshop, this may be done by making a copy of
our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1p7iOV5HNvy4POS4g6eottY8RSfKq4kaoKz1-jIFYTMI/template/preview" class="external-link">Virtual
Minute Card Template</a> on Google Forms. Other tools can work as well,
but we do recommend making sure that feedback is private and anonymous.
A public-facing sticky note board will receive different (and less
useful) feedback.</p>
<p>Whatever method you use, you may wish to customise the prompt to
elicit different types of feedback at each break.</p>
<p><strong>Example positive prompts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One thing you liked about this section of the workshop</li>
<li>The most important thing you learned today</li>
<li>A new skill, command, or technique you are most excited about
using</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example constructive prompts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One thing you did not like or would change about this section of the
workshop</li>
<li>One thing that is confusing / you would like clarification on.</li>
<li>One question you have</li>
</ul>
<p>During long breaks, instructors read through the minute cards and
look for patterns. At the start of each half day, the Instructors take a
few minutes to address commonly raised issues with the whole class. The

at the end of each day using a technique called “one up, one down”. The
instructor asks the learners to alternately give one positive and one

already been said. This requirement forces people to say things they
otherwise might not: once all the “safe” feedback has been given,
participants will start saying what they really think. The instructor
writes down the feedback in the Etherpad or a text editor, but does not
comment on the feedback while collecting it. The instructors then

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Teaching and learning are not the same process. As we have seen, an
instructor can make choices that facilitate the cognitive processes
necessary for learning to occur. But <strong>any technique can fall flat
when learners are not motivated</strong>. Worse, demotivation is
contagious! Teaching or sharing a classroom with demotivated learners is
not fun or rewarding. It can be tempting, especially for teachers facing
burnout after strenuous and ineffectual effort, to blame learners for
spoiling the classroom experience.</p>
<p>It is true that learner motivation is influenced by many factors well
beyond the control of an instructor, including individual background and
systemic forces. However, there are many things you can do to cultivate
motivation in your classroom, and perhaps most importantly, to
<strong>avoid doing harm</strong> to the precious drive your learners
bring to the classroom on day one. In Carpentries workshops, most
learners come eager to learn! You have the power to influence how they
feel when they depart.</p>
<p>No two-day workshop can truly bring a total novice to the level of a
competent practitioner. Carpentries workshops function in a context of
<em>self training</em>, in which workshops offer vital tools and a map
for learners to proceed on their own. Our workshops lower the barrier to
entry and help learners to get off on the right foot. In this context,
<strong>cultivating motivation to continue learning, and to carefully
pursue best-practices in doing so, is arguably the most important
outcome we can achieve</strong>.</p>
<p>This section discusses several ways that learners can be motivated
(or demotivated!) by instructional content and approaches, and provides
practice opportunities for you to become confident in motivating your
learners.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>People learn best when they care about a topic and believe they can
master it with a reasonable investment of time and effort. Many
scientists might appreciate the value of programming but believe that
developing useful skills will take more time than they have available.
This presents a problem because <strong>believing that something will be
too hard to learn often becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy</strong>.</p>
<p>One way to combat this problem is to begin a lesson with something
that is <strong>quick to learn and immediately useful</strong>. It is
particularly important that <em>learners</em> see it as useful in their
daily work. This not only motivates them, it also helps build their
confidence in us, so that if it takes longer to get to something they
find useful in a later topic, they will persist with the lesson.</p>
<p>Imagine a graph whose axes are labelled “mean time to master” and
“usefulness once mastered”. Tasks that are quick to master and
immediately useful should ideally be taught first; things in the
opposite corner that are time-consuming to learn and have little
near-term application should be avoided in our workshops.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/what-to-teach.png" alt='A stylised graph with y-axis labeled "usefulness once mastered" and and x-axis labeled "mean time to master". The upper left quadrant says "teach this first" and the lower right quadrant says "do not bother".' class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>Another way to think about the graph shown above is <strong>authentic
tasks</strong> – real tasks performed by someone doing their work. If
you can identify authentic tasks from your own work that could be useful
to others, these examples will be highly motivating.</p>

<p><strong>Think</strong> about some task you did this week that uses
one or more of the skills we teach, (e.g. wrote a function, bulk
downloaded data, built a plot in R, forked a repo) and explain how you
would use it (or a simplified version of it) as an exercise or example
in class. <strong>Pair</strong> up with your neighbor and decide where
this exercise fits on a graph of “short/long time to master” and
“low/high usefulness”. In the class Etherpad, <strong>share</strong> the
task and where it fits on the graph. As a group, we will discuss how
these relate back to our “teach most immediately useful first”
approach.</p>

<h3 class="callout-title">Actual Time</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Any useful estimate of time must take into account <strong>how
frequent failures are</strong> and how much time is lost to them. For
example, editing a text file seems like a quick task, but most graphical
editors save things to the user’s desktop or home directory. If a novice
needs to run shell commands on the files they’ve edited, they often fail
to navigate to the right directory without help. You will learn to
anticipate these sorts of challenges as you chart your <a href="04-expertise.html#expertise-and-teaching">expert awareness
gaps</a>. As a result, your skill at estimating time to mastery will
improve. If you are new to teaching, try to ask an experienced
instructor for feedback before trying out a new exercise.</p>

<p>While we aim to begin workshops with motivating content, in practice
this does not always occur. Workflow-based content like that taught in
Data Carpentry workshops may start at the beginning of the workflow, for
example. Even when a ‘motivating example’ is built in to the start of a
workshop, technical problems like software installation can turn those
precious first minutes into an experience of frustration and impatience.
That is ok! What is important is to <strong>be mindful of times when
your content is not motivating</strong>, and to strategise ways to
re-engage learners (and yourself) using some of the other techniques in
this section.</p>

<h3 id="invite-participation">Invite Participation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#invite-participation"></a>
</h3>
<p>Motivation is supported by active engagement. Participation allows
learners to ask questions, resolving roadblocks quickly, and demonstrate
knowledge, building confidence. It also facilitates learning! However,
in a room full of strangers, <strong>most learners will not immediately
feel comfortable speaking up</strong>, especially when they feel
confusion or doubt. Creating a motivating classroom means inviting
communication and reinforcing that invitation with an attentive
response.</p>
<p>A few ways to invite participation are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Establishing norms for interaction</strong>. This can be
done by creating procedures for communication, e.g. turn taking in
discussions, passing around a <em>talking stick</em>, or encouraging
quieter people to contribute. Having, discussing, and enforcing a <a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/policies/coc/" class="external-link">Code of Conduct</a>
also provides a framework for positive communication to occur.</li>
<li>
<strong>Encouraging learners to learn from each other</strong>.
Working in pairs, or <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming" class="external-link">pair
programming</a></em>, encourages learners to talk through their learning
process, reinforcing memory and making it more likely that confusion
will be expressed and resolved. This can also address challenges of
varying background experience: asking more advanced learners to help
beginners can maximise learning for both. In these cases, make sure the
beginner is doing the typing!</li>
<li>
<strong>Acknowledging when learners are confused</strong>.
Acknowledging and exploring confusion with kindness rewards learners for
sharing vulnerable information. It also helps you examine your expert
awareness gaps! Formative assessments can pinpoint misunderstandings.
When learners see that others are confused, they are more likely to
share their own uncertainties.</li>

<h3 id="encourage-a-growth-mindset">Encourage a Growth Mindset<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#encourage-a-growth-mindset"></a>
</h3>
<p>People vary in their beliefs about the nature of intelligence and
skill development. In academic environments, people are often praised as
“talented” or having “high ability”, and may develop an identity around
being a certain “type of person” who has inherent strengths or
weaknesses.</p>
<p>The belief that ability or intelligence is born rather than made –
dubbed a <strong>fixed mindset</strong> by Carol Dweck – may impact the
learning process. Broadly, this is a continuing topic of research and
debate in education communities. In the specific context of Carpentries
workshops, we frequently encounter learners who believe that they are
not “computational people,” and Instructors often report that this fixed
mindset interferes with motivation to engage fully with the task of
learning to program. We therefore recommend three types of interventions
that have been shown to influence mindset, encouraging learners to
believe that ability can be acquired through effort – a <strong>growth
mindset</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Positive error framing</strong>. Errors are inevitable when
learning a new skill. However, learners will often interpret errors as
indicators of inability – adopting a fixed mindset. Encouraging learners
to understand errors in a positive way – as an opportunity to learn
something they would have missed otherwise – reinforces a growth mindset
and helps them to stay motivated. Be sure to discuss this with your
helpers, since they are often the ‘first responders’ to learner
mistakes.</li>

<h3 class="callout-title">Helping Learners Learn From Mistakes</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>A learner at your workshop asks for your help with an exercise and
shows you their attempt at solving it. You see they’ve made an error
that shows they misunderstand something fundamental about the lesson
(for example, in the shell lesson, they forgot to put a space between
<code>ls</code> and the name of the directory they are looking at). What
would you say to the learner?</p>
<p>In the Etherpad, describe the error your learner has made and how you
would respond.</p>
<p>This exercise should take about 5 minutes.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Presenting the instructor as a learner</strong>. We want our
learners to have confidence in our qualifications, but it is easy to
take this too far. Presenting yourself as a learner offers a relatable
model, fostering a growth mindset and teaching a positive approach to
the continuing challenge of learning. Using <a href="17-live">participatory live coding</a>, our chosen method for
teaching concepts, is very useful for this reason. It is common to make
errors while coding. Embrace these with enthusiasm! Leveraging your own
mistakes as opportunities can turn an awkward moment into a highlight of
a lesson, demonstrating both problem-solving approaches and positive
error framing. If you are unlucky and fail to make any useful mistakes,
sharing stories about your learning process can help here, too.</li>

<li>
<strong>Praising effort or improvement, not performance or
ability</strong>. Praise based on the quality of performance often feels
like the highest praise because it goes straight to your identity as a
person of intellect and skill. When faced with a fixed mindset (“I’m not
a computational person!”), many well-intentioned teachers counter with
another fixed mindset (“You ARE a computational person! You’re really
good at this!”). However, this doesn’t prepare learners to interpret
future obstacles as irrelevant to innate ability. Evidence suggests that
learner perseverance is best supported in the long term by praising
effort or improvement instead. If you are not convinced of this,
consider the impact on the person sitting next to your target, who might
overhear but not receive the same praise.</li>

<h3 id="first-do-no-harm">First, Do No Harm!<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#first-do-no-harm"></a>
</h3>
<p>When learning a skill, we develop more than expert awareness gaps –
we also develop opinions about tools and methods, and sometimes base a
professional identity around displaying technical expertise. Technical
boasts, insults, and other showy moves can score points in conversation
with fellow experts, but these present serious hazards in the classroom!
Here are a few <strong>things you should not do in your
workshop:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Talk contemptuously or with scorn about any tool or
practice</strong>, or the people who use them. Regardless of its
shortcomings, many of your learners may be using that tool, and may have
invested many years in learning to do so. Convincing someone to change
their practices is much harder when they think you disdain them.</li>
<li>
<strong>Dive into complex or detailed technical discussion</strong>
with the one or two people in the audience who clearly don’t actually
need to be there. Reserve those conversations for breaks or follow-up
emails.</li>
<li>
<strong>Pretend to know more than you do</strong>. People will
actually trust you more if you are frank about the limitations of your
knowledge, and will be more likely to ask questions and seek help. (Also
see “Presenting the instructor as a learner,” above)</li>
<li>
<strong>Use the word “just” or other demotivating words</strong> we
talked about in a <a href="04-expertise.html">previous lesson</a>. These
signal to the learner that the instructor thinks their problem is
trivial and by extension that they therefore must be deficient if they
are not able to figure it out.</li>
<li>
<strong>Take over the learner’s keyboard</strong>. It is rarely a
good idea to type anything for your learners. Doing so can be
demotivating for the learner (as it implies you don’t think they can do
it themselves or that you don’t want to wait for them). It also wastes a
valuable opportunity for your learner to develop muscle memory and other
skills that are essential for independent work.</li>
<li>
<strong>Express surprise at unawareness</strong>. Saying things like
“I can’t believe you don’t know X” or “You’ve never heard of Y?” signals
to the learner that they do not have some required pre-knowledge of the
material you are teaching, that they don’t belong at the workshop, and
it may prevent them from asking questions in the future. For more on
this see the Recurse Center’s <a href="https://www.recurse.com/manual#sec-environment" class="external-link">Social
Rules</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It can be difficult to avoid these demotivators entirely. Some people
are so used to complaining about certain tools that they initially fail
to realise they’re doing it while teaching. If you catch yourself doing
this, you might find a way to walk it back, or consider how you might
repair or improve your motivational efforts on your next interaction.
Teaching yourself – and your helpers! – to avoid these types of comments
takes practice, but is well worth the effort.</p>

barriers that can result in members of some groups being excluded even
in an otherwise welcoming environment. The fact that some groups face
barriers that others do not means we cannot take a one size fits all
approach to creating a positive learning environment.</p>

<h3 id="definitions">Definitions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#definitions"></a>
</h3>
<p>This section addresses topics related to equity, inclusion, and
accessibility. These terms are increasingly common and may be familiar
to you, but not everyone understands or interprets them in the same way.
So, we will start with a few working definitions, adapted from the <a href="https://www.diversity.pitt.edu/education/glossary-terms" class="external-link">University
of Pittsburgh DEI Glossary</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Equity:</strong> The proportional distribution of desirable
outcomes across groups. Sometimes confused with equality, equity refers
to outcomes while equality connotes equal treatment.</li>
<li>
<strong>Inclusion:</strong> Actively engaging traditionally excluded
individuals and/or groups in processes, activities and decisions in a
way that shares power. Inclusion promotes broad engagement, shared
participation, and advances authentic sense of belonging through safe,
positive, and nurturing environments.</li>
<li>
<strong>Accessibility:</strong> Refers to the intentional design or
redesign of technology, policies, products, and services (to name a few)
that increase one’s ability to use, access, and obtain the respective
item. Each person is afforded the opportunity to acquire the same
information, engage in the same interactions, and enjoy the same
services in an equally effective and equally integrated manner, with
substantially equivalent ease of use.</li>

<p>Barriers to accessibility encountered in a workshop are demotivating
at best and can exclude a learner entirely. What barriers might be
present in your workshop, and what can you do to remove them?</p>

<h3 class="callout-title">What Happens When Accessibility is an Issue?</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Think of a time when you have been affected by, or noticed someone
else being affected by barriers to accessibility. This may have been at
a conference you attended where the elevator was out of service, or
maybe a class you were taking relied on audio delivery of content.
Describe what happened, how it impacted your (or someone else’s) ability
to be involved and what could have been done to provide better
accessibility in this case.</p>
<p>This exercise should take about 5 minutes.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>While it may not be possible to anticipate all needs, it <em>is</em>
possible to get a good working structure in place without any knowledge
of what specific disabilities people might have. Having some
accommodations prepared also demonstrates care, helping learners to
trust that additional requests are likely to be well received.</p>
<p>If you are playing the host role (or part of it), note that our <a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/resources/workshops/email_templates.html" class="external-link">host
template</a> includes an inquiry regarding accessibility needs. However,
be aware that <strong>many people will not feel comfortable requesting
accommodations in advance</strong>, or at all if it can be avoided. For
example, a participant who is hard of hearing may simply hope that
instructors will speak loudly enough for them to hear. Taking steps to
make your workshop maximally accessible can relieve your participants of
the need to disclose personal information.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="from-accommodation-to-universal-design">From Accommodation to Universal Design<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#from-accommodation-to-universal-design"></a>
</h3>
<p>Accommodation means changing things to serve an individual with a
demonstrated need. However, <strong>accommodation puts the onus on the
individual with the need</strong> to have to disclose their disability
and ask for accommodations. Reluctance to do so is understandable:
requests for accommodation are often met with negative emotions such as
uncertainty, confusion, annoyance or anger by those receiving the
requests.</p>
<p>By contrast, “universal design” means creating something to be
maximally usable by all people without additional changes. A good
example of universal design is curb cuts and sidewalk ramps. While they
were originally created to make it easier for wheelchair users to move
around, they proved to be equally helpful to people with strollers and
grocery carts.</p>

<p>In the 1990s, the Center for Applied Special Technology (CAST)
brought Universal Design into Education with the <a href="https://udlguidelines.cast.org" class="external-link">Universal Design for Learning
(UDL) Framework</a>. UDL places responsibility for accessibility on the
course designer rather than on the learner. It states that the most
inclusive approach to education is to design instruction with diverse
learners in mind from the beginning.</p>
<p>UDL is not about finding the one, best way to teach everyone. The key
to UDL is creating redundancies such that learners have multiple options
in how they:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>receive</li>
<li>engage, and</li>
<li>share information.</li>

<p>Looking at people who work with disability and accessibility, it’s
easy to be overwhelmed by all the different ways we could make
instruction more accessible.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>It is ok not to do everything at once.</em> We do not ask
learners in our workshops to adopt all our best practices or tools in
one go, but instead to add things gradually at a rate they can manage.
Similarly, try to build in accessibility habits when preparing for
workshops through reflective practice, adding something new each
time.</li>
<li>
<em>Do the easy things first.</em> There are plenty of ways to make
workshops more accessible that are both quick to accomplish and minimal

<p>As Instructors, many aspects of our classroom environment are within
our control or influence. However, the world is a complicated place, and
there will always be extraneous factors that contribute to demotivation
and add to cognitive load. These vary from person to person, but members
of certain groups often carry a heavier load due to systemic forces that
disproportionately impact them. What we can control, in this case, is
our own awareness of the challenges these forces present to teaching and
learning. As with other demotivation pitfalls, we can also think
carefully about the language that we use and how we interact with our
learners to avoid reinforcing systemic bias.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="stereotypes">Stereotypes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#stereotypes"></a>
</h3>
<p>We all use stereotypes, and for good reason. They serve a cognitive
purpose. <a href="https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/1566" class="external-link">One
study</a> suggests we encounter more than 34 gigabytes of information
every day. That is more information than we could ever process, so our
brains use shortcuts. What an expert thing to do! Stereotypes are one of
those shortcuts. As with other models, they are all wrong… but some are
dangerous.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="what-are-stereotypes">What are stereotypes?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-are-stereotypes"></a>
</h3>
<p>Stereotypes are an established feature of human social cognition, in
which a set of characteristics is associated with members of a group.
Stereotypes:</p>
<ul>
<li>may be explicit (conscious and deliberate) or implicit (unconscious
and automatic)</li>
<li>guide what we notice about people</li>
<li>guide how we interpret people’s behaviors</li>
<li>can facilitate quick judgements in appropriate situations
(e.g. stopping a child from driving a car)</li>
<li>can lead to systematically negative attitudes and behaviors towards
members of certain groups</li>
</ul>
<p>Stereotypes are dangerous when they are explicit, but they are
especially hazardous when they are implicit. This means that the people
holding them may not be aware of them, even though their perceptions are
guided by them.</p>
<p><strong>When Instructors have stereotypes about learners</strong>,
this may lead them to:</p>
<ul>
<li>call attention to differences unnecessarily</li>
<li>give more or less attention to certain learners</li>
<li>respond to questions differently for certain learners</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When learners experience stereotypes about
themselves</strong>, they may:</p>
<ul>
<li>develop a fixed mindset about aspects of their own capability</li>
<li>experience increased cognitive load when reminded about a
stereotype, interfering with the learning process. This is known as
<em>stereotype threat</em>.</li>

<p>One way to support at-risk learners of all kinds is to ask people to
sign up for workshops in small teams rather than as individuals when
possible. If an entire lab group comes, or if attendees are drawn from
the same (or closely-related) disciplines, everyone in the room will
know in advance that they will be with at least a few people they trust,
which increases the chances of them actually coming. Furthermore, if
people attend a workshop with their labmates, it’s more likely they will
work together to implement what they’ve learned after the workshop has
ended.</p>

Because these experiences are unequal, including historical and

avenues towards career success, we aim to make Carpentries programs
<em>equitable</em>. This means that, rather than offering the same
access and experience to all, we aim to use our programs to actively
counter-balance unequal opportunities that have led to disproportionate
representation of certain groups in data-centric careers.</p>

<p>One central way that The Carpentries fosters an inclusive, respectful
learning environment is our <a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/policies/coc/" class="external-link">Code of
Conduct</a>.</p>
<p>All participants in our workshops, activities and communities are
required to abide by the <a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/policies/coc/" class="external-link">Code of Conduct</a>.
This code helps to ensure that our community does not tolerate the
persistence of behaviors that harm or exclude others. While such a code
cannot prevent all incidents, reminding participants of the Code of
Conduct supports them in being mindful of the impact of their words and
actions. It also offers reassurance to all that the instructional team
cares about their experience, creating an environment that is explicitly
inclusive and supports safe focus on learning.</p>
<p>We will discuss the Code of Conduct in greater detail in Part 4 of
this training during our discussion of <a href="21-management.html">Working with your team</a>.</p>

</h3>
<p>Motivating practices like those discussed in the <a href="08-motivation.html">previous episode</a> to invite participation
and encourage a growth mindset can also contribute to making a classroom
more inclusive for diverse learners. However, we cannot assume that any
instructional approach has succeeded at fostering inclusion if we do not
listen to our audience. Explicitly seeking to learn from and attend to
the concerns of your learners is key. If you find yourself feeling
uncertain about whether you are successfully including all learners,
this is a good time to pause and create an opportunity to listen.</p>
<p>When you are actively providing avenues for feedback, there are two
signs of trouble to watch out for: negative feedback, and a <strong>lack
of feedback</strong>. If an environment does not feel inclusive, many
learners will not feel comfortable reporting this; indeed, they may not
recognise it themselves. It can be difficult to notice the people you
are <em>not</em> hearing from in a room! When in doubt, communicate with
your team and work together to identify and (gently) check in with
anyone you haven’t heard from. In addition, examine your feedback
processes to be sure you are including opportunities for
<strong>anonymous feedback</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="examining-your-actions">Examining your Actions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#examining-your-actions"></a>
</h3>
<p>When you pay close attention to your own actions, this can help you
to do more than (painfully) identify how often you use the word “just”!
Monitoring your actions can also provide you with useful information
about the ways in which you behave differently with different people.
This is normal! It is also an excellent way to identify patterns that
may interfere with your intent to create an inclusive environment for
all. Did you answer the same question in different ways at different
points? If so, why? Who did you feel comfortable chatting with at break
time, and who seemed harder to connect with? Did you offer help to
anyone who didn’t ask for it? Who were you most eager to impress?</p>
<p>Asking yourself questions like these is hard! Answering them is
harder. When you notice things that trouble you, keep a positive and
simple goal in mind: to learn and to improve.</p>

<p>So far, we have focused on how we can be effective instructors by
understanding how people learn and how to create a positive classroom
environment, covering two of our primary goals in helping you become a
certified Carpentries Instructor. Now our focus will shift to developing
additional teaching skills that you can use in a Carpentries workshop
setting, starting with the process of “lesson study”, or teaching
observation and feedback.</p>
<section><h2 class="section-heading" id="lesson-study-applying-a-growth-mindset-to-teaching">Lesson Study: Applying a Growth Mindset to Teaching<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#lesson-study-applying-a-growth-mindset-to-teaching"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>We have seen that providing opportunities for practice and giving
useful feedback to learners are essential components in the learning
process. Learning to teach is no different.</p>
<p>However, many people assume that teachers are born, not made. From
politicians to researchers and teachers themselves, most reformers have
designed systems to find and promote those who can teach and eliminate
those who cannot. As Elizabeth Green describes in <em><a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/building-a-better-teacher-how-teaching-works-and-how-to-teach-it-to-everyone/oclc/953075081" class="external-link">Building
a Better Teacher</a></em>, though, that assumption is wrong, which is
why educational reforms based on it have repeatedly failed.</p>
<p>To assume that teaching is an “inherited” or innate skill is to take
on a fixed mindset about teaching. A growth mindset believes that anyone
can become a better teacher by the same methods we use to learn any
subject – reflective practice. More specifically, instructors develop
teaching skill over time through practice and improve most when given
feedback on their performance from other instructors who share their
pedagogical model.</p>
<p>We know that teachers can learn how to teach because of research done
on the Japanese method of jugyokenkyu or “lesson study.”</p>
<p>In the 1980s and 90s, an educational psychologist named James Stigler
observed teachers in the US and Japan. In the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/pisa/" class="external-link">OECD’s annual rankings</a> of
countries’ educational achievements, Japanese students routinely test
near the top in reading, math and science, while American students rank
at or below average.</p>
<p>Looking at differences in teaching methods, Stigler found that
American teachers met at most once a year to exchange ideas about
teaching, compared to the weekly or even daily meetings of Japanese
teachers. During these meetings, teachers in the US described their
lessons to each other, but they did not observe each others’ teaching in
practice. In contrast, Japanese teachers regularly conducted lesson
study: observing each other at work, discussing the lesson afterward,
and studying curriculum materials with their colleagues.</p>
<p>The situation is different in many English-language school systems:
in the US, Canada, the UK, Australia, and elsewhere, where often what
happens in the classroom stays in the classroom. Teachers are not able
to watch each other’s lessons on a regular basis, so they cannot borrow
each other’s good ideas. The result is that <em>every teacher has to
invent teaching on their own</em>. They may get lesson plans and
assignments from colleagues, the school board, a textbook publisher, or
the Internet, but each teacher has to figure out on their own how to
combine that with the theory they have learned in their educational
programs to deliver an actual lesson in an actual classroom for actual
learners. When teachers do not observe each other teaching, the tricks
and techniques that each instructor has painstakingly incorporated into
their practice do not have the opportunity to spread, limiting forward
momentum on system-wide improvements to teaching.</p>
<p>Therefore, just like other disciplines (sports and music are two good
examples), teachers benefit from closely observing the work of others.
The Carpentries pedagogical model supports lesson study by providing
many opportunities for our instructors to learn from each other. In this
training, you will have opportunities to practice teaching for one
another and to give each other feedback. You will also have the
opportunity to practice in front of an experienced instructor as part of
your instructor training checkout. In addition, Carpentries Instructors
always teach in pairs (or more), giving you the opportunity to learn by
observing and to get feedback from your fellow instructors.</p>

<h3 class="callout-title">Reading It Is Not Enough</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Several research studies (in <a href="files/papers/fincher-warrens-questions-2007.pdf">2007</a>, <a href="files/papers/fincher-stories-change-2012.pdf">2012</a>, and <a href="files/papers/barker-practice-adoption-2015.pdf">2015</a>) have
shown that teachers do not adopt instructional practices based on
reports about the effectiveness of those practices. Social norms,
institutional culture, and lack of time and support prevent many
teachers from moving out of their accustomed teaching habits. Change in
teaching does not come about through reading about new teaching
practices, but by seeing these practices in action, practicing them and
getting feedback from other instructors.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Sometimes it can be hard to receive feedback, especially negative
feedback.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/deathbulge-jerk.jpg" title="Comic from http://www.deathbulge.com/comics/155" alt="A three panel comic. In the first panel, a smiling figure is surrounded by speech bubbles with mostly positive feedback. In the second panel, the figure is eating dinner. All of the previous speech bubbles appear faded out, except the one negative bubble. The third panel shows the figure in bed, with an unhappy face, with the one piece of negative feedback lingering after all others have faded." class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>Feedback is most effective when the people involved share ground
rules and expectations. In Carpentries teaching, we use the
<strong>2x2</strong> paradigm for feedback. Each person giving feedback
is expected to provide at least one piece of <strong>negative</strong>
and one piece of <strong>positive</strong> feedback each for
<strong>content</strong> and <strong>delivery</strong>. This helps
overcome two common tendencies when giving feedback on teaching: to
focus on the content (even though delivery is at least as important) and
to either provide only negative or only positive feedback.</p>
<p>Here is a list of different ways that you can set the stage for
receiving or providing feedback in a way that facilitates growth.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Initiate feedback.</strong> Most people will not offer it
freely, and those who do are not the only voices you should listen to.
Also, it is easier to hear feedback that you have asked for.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be specific.</strong> See a great example of this from
this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210513225525/http://www.lunarbaboon.com/comics/feedback.html" class="external-link">Lunar
Baboon comic</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As an instructor one way to get specific feedback is to provide
questions that focus the responses. Writing your own feedback questions
allows you to frame feedback in a way that is helpful to you - the
questions below reveal what did not work in your teaching, but read as
professional suggestions rather than personal judgments. For
example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“What is one thing I could have done as an instructor to make
this lesson more effective?”</p></li>
<li><p>“If you could pick one thing from the lesson to go over again,
what would it be?”</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Balance</strong> positive and negative feedback.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask for or give “compliment sandwiches” (one positive, one negative,
one positive)</li>
<li>Ask for both types of feedback, and give both types.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Provide a clear next step</strong> with negative feedback
to follow that will help the recipient improve.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Communicate expectations.</strong> If your teaching
feedback is taking the form of an observation (and you are comfortable
enough with the observer), tell that person how they can best
communicate their feedback to you.</p></li>
<li><p>When giving feedback, <strong>remember that giving and receiving
feedback is a skill</strong> that requires practice, so do not be
frustrated if your feedback is rejected but try to think about why the
recipient might not have been comfortable with the feedback you
gave.</p></li>
<li><p>Use a <strong>feedback translator.</strong> Have a fellow
instructor (or other trusted person in the room) read over all the
feedback and give an executive summary. It can be easier to hear “It
sounds like most people are following, so you could speed up” than to
read several notes all saying, “this is too slow” or “this is
boring”.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is part of the reason for The Carpentries rule, “Never teach
alone.” Having another Instructor in the classroom divides the effort,
but more importantly, it is a chance for Instructors to learn from one
another and be a supportive voice in the room.</p>
<p>Finally, be kind to yourself. If you are a self-critical person, it
is OK to remind yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>The feedback is not personal. In many cases, feedback says more
about the person giving it than the person receiving it.</li>
<li>There are always positives along with the negatives. Save your
favourites to review regularly!</li>

<h3 class="callout-title">Giving Feedback</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>We will start by observing some examples of teaching and providing
some feedback.</p>
<p>Watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxgMVwQamO0" class="external-link">example teaching
video</a> as a group and then give feedback on it: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxgMVwQamO0" class="external-link">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxgMVwQamO0</a>.</p>
<p>English and Spanish captions are available by clicking the settings
icon in the video.</p>
<p>Put your feedback in the Etherpad. Organise your feedback along two
axes: - positive vs. opportunities for growth (sometimes called
“negative”) and - content (what was said) vs. presentation (how it was
said).</p>
<p>This exercise should take about 10 minutes.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now that you have had some practice observing teaching and giving
feedback, let us practice with each other.</p>

<li>After the first person has finished their introduction, share
feedback. The person who performed should start by offering feedback on
themselves. The timekeeper should help to keep feedback to about 5

<p>Look back at the feedback you received on your teaching. How do you

<p>Hopefully you were able to identify at least one helpful comment in
the feedback you received and are able to use it to start (or continue)
the process of improving your teaching. Remember, teaching is a skill
that is learned. If you notice yourself feeling hurt or threatened by
the feedback you got, or rejecting it as unfair or wrong, pause and try
to consider the feedback from a growth mindset - that through practice
and feedback, your skills are going to improve. By strengthening your
growth mindset with respect to teaching, you can transform getting
feedback from an unpleasant experience to a richly rewarding one. You
will have more opportunities to practice teaching and to get and give
feedback in parts 3 and 4.</p>

<p>In the first half of this training we have focused on understanding
some core findings of pedagogical research about how the learning
process works and the importance of creating a positive classroom
environment. We also introduced the idea of lesson study and gave some
opportunities to practice teaching. In the remaining parts of the
training, we will continue our discussions of how we build teaching
skill and will have more chances for practice and feedback. We will also
look in some depth at how The Carpentries operates to prepare you for
the logistics of teaching a workshop.</p>
<p>To prepare for our next session, please:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Read about <a href="https://carpentries.org/workshops/#workshop-organising" class="external-link">centrally-organised
and self-organised workshops</a> and our handbook content on <a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/resources/workshops/" class="external-link">Teaching and
Hosting Workshops</a> – be sure to click through to some of the
associated checklists. These summarise commonly asked questions about
organizing and running workshops. When you arrive for the next part, we
will ask you to add one question about our operations to a list. We will
then do our best to answer all of those questions during the
day.</p></li>
<li><p>Prepare for the <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/17-live.html" class="external-link">live
coding exercises</a>. If you have not already done so per the
pre-workshop instructions, pick an episode from an existing Software
Carpentry, Data Carpentry, or Library Carpentry lesson and read through
it carefully. In the next two parts, you will use this to practice live
coding/participatory instruction for 3 minutes. These future exercises
do not have built in prep time like the short 90 second teaching
practice we did earlier. Your preparation <strong>before</strong> we
start tomorrow is all of your preparation time. Remember, imperfect
presentations can generate useful feedback! If you have not yet selected

<p>To refresh as we enter the second half of this training, the goal of
this training is to prepare you to be a certified Carpentries
Instructor, which includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>be familiar with and understand how to apply research-based teaching
principles, especially as they apply to The Carpentries audience.</li>
<li>understand the importance of a respectful and inclusive classroom
environment; commit to creating such an environment; and be able to
identify and implement The Carpentries policies and general practices to
accomplish this.</li>
<li>practice and develop skills in the teaching methods used in
Carpentries workshops</li>
<li>learn enough about The Carpentries organisation to know where to go
for help, how to start organizing a workshop, and how to get involved
with community activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>So far we have focused on general aspects of educational psychology
and pedagogy and how to create a positive classroom environment,
addressing the first two goals. We started to address the third goal by
discussing the importance of lesson study and observation, and by
providing an opportunity to teach and receive feedback. We will continue
that skill development process in Part 3 and 4, as we focus on the
specifics of teaching Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, and Library
Carpentry workshops. We will review specific teaching practices we
follow at our workshops and practice using some of them. One of the most
important practices in The Carpentries is participatory live coding. We
will spend some time practicing this skill for multiple reasons: one,
you rarely find this approach in a current university setting so it is
good to try it out, but also, this will give us a chance to continue
developing skills we discussed so far that help improve our teaching:
reflective practice and providing (and receiving!) constructive
feedback. In the final sections of the training, we will conclude our
training with a discussion about workshop logistics that will help you
in preparing to teach your first workshop and become involved in The
Carpentries community.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>You can teach any Carpentries workshops!</strong>
Carpentries Instructor badges are valid to teach any Software Carpentry,
Data Carpentry, or Library Carpentry lesson. You can teach branded
workshops locally, or network with experienced co-Instructors as a
volunteer with our global community. While local co-Instructors need not
be badged or experienced, every Carpentries branded workshop must have
at least one badged Instructor to lead the way. (More on branding in the
next episode!)</li>
<li>
<strong>You get to vote!</strong> Badged Instructors are eligible to
vote in Carpentries Executive Council elections for their first year,
and for all subsequent years in which they continue to participate
through teaching or other involvement. See the <a href="https://carpentries.org/about-us/governance/#carpentries-bylaws-and-policies" class="external-link">Carpentries
Bylaws</a> for rules governing continuing voting eligibility.</li>

pursuing goals that matter to them and creating relationships across the

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p><a href="https://software-carpentry.org/" class="external-link">Software Carpentry</a> was
founded in 1998 with the mission of teaching lab skills for research
computing.</p>
<p><a href="https://datacarpentry.org/" class="external-link">Data Carpentry</a> was founded
in 2014 with the mission of building communities teaching universal data
literacy.</p>
<p>Also in 2014, <a href="https://librarycarpentry.org/" class="external-link">Library
Carpentry</a> was founded with the mission of teaching data skills to
people working in library- and information-related roles.</p>
<p>On January 1, 2018, Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry merged to
form a new project called <a href="https://carpentries.org/" class="external-link">The
Carpentries</a> under the fiscal sponsorship of <a href="https://communityin.org/" class="external-link">Community Initiatives</a>. Within this
new organisation structure, Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry
retained their identities as Lesson Programs of The Carpentries. On
November 1, 2018, The Carpentries governance (formerly known as the
Executive Council) approved <a href="https://librarycarpentry.org/" class="external-link">Library Carpentry</a> as the third
official Lesson Program of The Carpentries.</p>
<p>On February 1, 2025, The Carpentries became an independent 501(c)(3)
non-profit organisation, now called The Carpentries, Inc. (The
Carpentries), governed by a <a href="https://carpentries.org/about-us/governance/" class="external-link">Board of
Directors</a>. Non-profit status provides a stable foundation for
long-term planning and sustainability. As an independent organisation,
The Carpentries has more flexibility in decision-making, program
development, and organisational structure, allowing the opportunity to
adapt more easily to the changing needs of the community.</p>
<p>The Carpentries administration and other essential operations are
managed by the <a href="https://carpentries.org/team/" class="external-link">Core Team</a>,
but the majority of our impact is achieved through the efforts of
volunteer participants in our global and local communities. The
<strong>global Carpentries community</strong> consists of <a href="https://carpentries.org/community/instructors/" class="external-link">Instructors</a>,
<a href="https://carpentries.org/community/instructor-trainers/" class="external-link">Instructor
Trainers</a>, <a href="https://carpentries.org/community/maintainers/" class="external-link">Maintainers</a>,
<a href="https://carpentries.org/community/lesson_developers/" class="external-link">Lesson
Developers</a>, <a href="https://carpentries.org/support/membership/member-list/" class="external-link">Institutional
Partners</a>, members of various committees, a <a href="https://carpentries.org/governance/" class="external-link">governance structure</a>, and
other supporters who participate, synchronously or asynchronously, in
building our programs for all to share. At the <strong>local
level</strong>, individual Carpentries communities may include many
participants who are not necessarily connected with or even aware of our
global activities, including helpers, learners, faculty sponsors, and
others who contribute to keep communities thriving and growing ‘on the
ground.’</p>
<figure><img src="fig/The-Carpentries-History-Timeline.png" alt="A graphic depicting the development of The Carpentries. It is titled “A Brief History of The Carpentries” with The Carpentries logo to the left of the title. The graphic is a snaking timeline chart summarising significant transitions in The Carpentries' history from 1998 to 2025. Not all years are represented. Under each year is a brief summary of the key developments in that year, with logos of the funder organisations that supported that phase of the organisation's projects. The dates and accompanying text are as follows: 1998: Software Carpentry is founded by Greg Wilson and Brent Gorda. 2001: Lesson materials are made open source with support from the Python Software Foundation. 2003: Software Carpentry efforts scaled with support from Alfred P. Sloan Foundation &amp; Mozilla Science Lab. 2013: First Software Carpentry for Librarians workshops in US &amp; Canada. 2014: Data Carpentry founded by Karen Cranston, Hilmar Lapp, Tracy Teal, and Ethan White with support from NSF. 2014: James Baker receives support from Software Sustainability Institute to develop and implement Library Carpentry. 2014: Software Carpentry Foundation is founded under NumFOCUS. 2015: Data Carpentry efforts scaled with support from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. 2018: Software Carpentry &amp; Data Carpentry merge to form The Carpentries as a fiscally sponsored project of Community Initiatives. Library Carpentry later joins as a new lesson program. 2019: CZI supports The Carpentries to scale its programs, and build capacity with local communities. 2020: Online Workshops begin. 2025: On 1 February The Carpentries transitions out of fiscal sponsor-ship into an independent 501(c)(3) non-profit organisation." class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>You can learn more about the history and goals of each Lesson Program

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>All lesson programs under The Carpentries share the same <a href="https://carpentries.org/values/" class="external-link">core values</a>. Their aligned
missions are accomplished by running accessible, inclusive training
workshops; teaching openly available, high-quality, community-developed
lessons; and fostering an active, inclusive, diverse instructor
community that promotes and models reproducible research as a community
norm.</p>
<p>Similarities between Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry, and Software
Carpentry workshops include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a focus on technical skills,</li>
<li>a two full day or four half day format taught by volunteer
instructors, and</li>
<li>a focus on filling gaps in current training for learners.</li>
</ul>
<p>The major differences between Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry, and
Software Carpentry workshops are their content and intended audience.
Their similarities and differences are depicted in this diagram:</p>
<figure><img src="fig/carpentries-venn-diagram_20200904.svg" alt="Three intersecting circles labelled Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, and Library Carpentry. Software and Data Carpentry both focus on research focused computational skills. Data and Library Carpentry are both domain targeted. Software and Library Carpentry both have a modular curriculum.

<p>The names “Data Carpentry”, “Library Carpentry”, and “Software

<p>Note that as long as you have at least one certified Instructor, the
other instructors and helpers at a branded workshop do not have to be
certified. We rely on your judgment as a certified Instructor to recruit
and orient volunteers who will support you in implementing The
Carpentries values and practices. <strong>We do expect you to have at
least one co-Instructor and helpers</strong>, even if they are not
certified instructors.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Briefly, there are two types of Carpentries workshops:
<strong>centrally-organised</strong> and
<strong>self-organised</strong>. You can read (and hopefully have
already read) about these on our <a href="https://carpentries.org/workshops/#workshop-organising" class="external-link">website</a>.</p>
<p>Centrally organised workshops are included in institutional <a href="https://carpentries.org/membership/" class="external-link">membership</a> packages and
can also be requested separately for a fee. Since The Carpentries will
recruit Instructors to teach, this is a great way to host workshops
before your local Instructor team feels fully prepared to run a complete
workshop independently, or to host workshops beyond the areas of
expertise you may have locally.</p>
<p>If you have enough local Instructors available to organise your own
workshop, you can run a self-organised workshop at any time at no cost.
If you need support with AWS instances for a Genomics workshop, there
may be an associated fee. You can learn more about Genomic workshops in
the <a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/resources/workshops/genomics_policy.html" class="external-link">Genomics
Workshops Terms of Agreement</a>. If you would like to recruit
additional Instructors or Helpers, <a href="https://carpentries.org/blog/2021/06/recruiting-instructors-for-self-organised-workshops/" class="external-link">this
blog post</a> has guidelines for using Carpentries communications
channels. Registering your workshop with us allows you to use The
Carpentries branding, includes our pre- and post- workshop surveys and
results for your workshop, and ensures that all Instructors and Helpers
in our database have the experience recorded in their profile.
Registering your workshop also helps us: reporting on our global impact
is vital to our future funding opportunities, allowing us to continue to
provide and develop materials and opportunities for you.</p>
<p>Once you have selected your workshop type, consult <a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/" class="external-link"><strong>The Carpentries
Handbook</strong></a> for more resources to support your organising
effort. The Carpentries Handbook is the definitive source for policies
and information, including tips, checklists, and points of contact for
nearly all Carpentries-related activities. A few examples of useful
content include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/resources/workshops/" class="external-link">template
emails and checklists</a> for Hosts, Instructors, and Helpers</li>
<li>the <a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/handbooks/instructors.html#instructor-training-attendance-policy" class="external-link">instructor
no-show policy</a> which is important to read before signing up for your
first workshop</li>
</ul>
<p>As The Carpentries grows and changes in response to a complex global
legal landscape, our policies and procedures are likely to change. Be
sure to check back for policy changes, and keep in touch on our <a href="https://carpentries.org/connect/" class="external-link">communications channels</a> to
stay abreast of the latest updates!</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>Many Instructors aim to teach within a local community and do not
want to travel. In that case, you will coordinate with your community to
gain access to teaching opportunities through locally organised
workshops.</p>
<p>If you want to be presented with opportunities to teach outside your
community – locally or far from home, be sure to join our <a href="https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/instructors" class="external-link">Instructors
mailing list</a>. This is how we recruit Instructors to teach in
centrally-organised workshops around the world.</p>
<p>The Carpentries can not guarantee that all Instructors who respond to
recruitment calls will be selected, and depending on your area these
opportunities may be scarce. If you want to get started right away,
consider organizing your own workshop or even teaching a single lesson
with a few friends. If your friends have not been through Instructor
Training, you will need to set aside some time to help them understand
how best to support your efforts.</p>

<p>With a partner, take turns asking and answering the question: “I want
to organise a workshop! What will I need to do?” One partner should ask
about a self-organised workshop, and the other can ask about a
centrally-organised workshop. If you have a third person, they can help
out with follow-up questions or answers as needed.</p>
<p>When you encounter new questions during this process, be sure to
write them in the Etherpad.</p>

<p>One of the cornerstones of The Carpentries teaching is live coding:
<em>instructors do not use slides to teach coding</em>, but work through
the lesson material, typing in the code or instructions, with the
workshop participants following along. This section explains how it
works, why we use it, and gives general tips for an effective
participatory live coding presentation. We will finish this section by
practicing ourselves and providing feedback for each other.</p>
<section><h2 class="section-heading" id="why-participatory-live-coding">Why Participatory Live Coding?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#why-participatory-live-coding"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>We do not use slides in our lessons. Instead, instructors plug their
laptop into the projector and work through the lesson, typing in the
code, reformatting data, and talking as we go. This is called <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding" class="external-link">live
coding</a></strong>. However, the instructor is not live coding in a
vacuum. Importantly, learners are strongly encouraged to
<strong>code-along</strong> with the instructor. We refer to the
practice of having the instructor live code and the learners code along
as <strong>participatory live coding</strong> or, less formally,
<strong>code-along sessions</strong>.</p>

both a learner’s and an instructor’s point of view in the Etherpad.</p>

<div id="collapseSolution1" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="headingSolution1" data-bs-parent="#accordionSolution1">
<div class="accordion-body">
<p>Some advantages are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Watching a program being written is more compelling than watching
someone page through slides that present bits and pieces of the same
code.</li>
<li>It enables instructors to be more responsive to “what if?”
questions. Where a slide deck is like a railway track, participatory
live coding allows instructors to go off-road and follow their learners’
interests.</li>
<li>Lateral knowledge transfer: participatory live coding facilitates
the transfer of <a href="https://jonudell.net/udell/2006-09-19-screencasting-of-tacit-knowledge.html" class="external-link">tacit
knowledge</a> – people learn more than we realised we were teaching by
watching <em>how</em> instructors do things.</li>
<li>It slows the instructor down: if she has to type in the program as
she goes along, she can only go twice as fast as her learners, rather
than ten-fold faster as she could with slides.</li>
<li>Learners get to see instructors’ mistakes <em>and how to diagnose
and correct them</em>. Novices are going to spend most of their time
doing this, but it is left out of most textbooks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some challenges are:</p>
<ul>
<li>It requires instructors to be able to improvise when things go wrong
or when learners have questions not directly addressed in the text of
the lesson.</li>
<li>It can be hard for learners to listen and type at the same time, due
to the <em>split-attention effect</em> we <a href="05-memory.html#why-guided-practice-is-important">discussed
earlier</a>. This is why it is very important that instructors first
explain what they are going to do, then say what they are typing as they
type it, and then explain what they did again afterwards.</li>
<li>It may take a bit of practice for instructors to get used to
thinking aloud while coding in front of an audience.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Live coding fits well into the practice-feedback model we have been
discussing - by providing learners with continuous opportunities for
practice (every time they type in a line of code) and continuous
feedback (their code either works or fails with an error message). It is
important to keep in mind, however, that feedback is not helpful if you
cannot understand it. Many error messages are obscure and not written
with novices in mind. Continue to use the strategies for error framing
that <a href="08-motivation.html">we learned earlier</a> to make sure
this feedback is useful to learners.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Debugging as a skill</strong> – while learners may have
negative associations with “mistakes” or “typos”, it may be useful to
re-frame troubleshooting as the routine process of finding and fixing
“bugs”.</p></li>
<li><p>Learning to parse error messages is an important step in
developing debugging skills.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Intentional vs accidental errors</strong> - It can be
useful to intentionally demonstrate common mistakes and error messages.
Alternatively, mistakes made by the Instructor or learners can offer
useful opportunities to learn about and positively frame
errors.</p></li>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Stand up and move around the room if possible.</strong> This
makes the experience more interactive and less monotonous. Use a
microphone if one is available to make it easier for people with hearing
difficulties to hear you.</li>
<li>
<strong>Go slowly.</strong> For every command you type, every word
of code you write, every menu item or website button you click, say out
loud what you are doing while you do it. Then point to the command and
its output on the screen and go through it a second time. This slows you
down and allows learners to copy what you do, or to catch up. Do not
copy-paste code.</li>
<li>
<strong>Mirror your learners’ environment.</strong> Try to create an
environment that is as similar as possible to what your learners have to
reduce cognitive load. Avoid using keyboard shortcuts.</li>
<li>
<strong>Use your screen wisely.</strong> Use a big font, and
maximise the window. A black font on a white background works better
than a light font on a dark background. When the bottom of the projector
screen is at the same height, or below, the heads of the learners,
people in the back will not be able to see the lower parts. Draw up the
bottom of your window(s) to compensate. Pay attention to the lighting
(not too dark, no lights directly on/above the presenter’s screen) and
if needed, re-position the tables so all learners can see the screen,
and helpers can easily reach all learners.</li>
<li>
<strong>Use illustrations</strong> to help learners understand and
organise the material. You can also generate the illustrations on the
board as you progress through the material. This allows you to build up
diagrams, making them increasingly complex in parallel with the material
you are teaching. It helps learners understand the material, makes for a
more lively workshop and gathers the learners’ attention to you as
well.</li>
<li>
<strong>Turn off notifications</strong> on your laptop and
phone.</li>
<li>
<strong>Stick to the lesson material.</strong> The core Carpentries
lessons are developed collaboratively by many instructors and tried and
tested at many workshops. This means they are very streamlined - which
is great when you start teaching them for the first time. It may be
tempting to deviate from the material because you would like to show a
neat trick, or demonstrate some alternative way of doing something. Do
not do this, since there is a fair chance you will run into something
unexpected that you then have to explain. If you really want to use
something outside of the material, try it out thoroughly before the
workshop: run through the lesson as you would during the actual teaching
and test the effect of your modification. Some instructors use printouts
of the lesson material during teaching. Others use a second device
(tablet or laptop) when teaching, on which they can view their notes and
the Etherpad session. This seems to be more reliable than displaying one
virtual desktop while flipping back and forth to another.</li>
<li>
<strong>Leave no learner behind.</strong> You will learn later in
the training <a href="21-management.html#sticky-notes">how sticky notes
can be used to gauge learners’ progress and understanding</a>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Embrace mistakes.</strong> No matter how well prepared you
are, you will make mistakes. This is OK! Use these opportunities to do
<a href="08-motivation.html">error framing</a> and to help your learners
learn the art of troubleshooting.</li>
<li>
<strong>Have fun!</strong> It is OK to use humor and improvisation
to liven up the workshop. This becomes easier when you are more familiar
with the material, and more relaxed. Start small, even just saying ‘that
was fun’ after something worked well is a good start.</li>

<p>In this training we have discussed many cognitive principles and
teaching practices that guide the design and implementation of
Carpentries Workshops. We hope you are feeling excited and optimistic
about putting those concepts to work! One thing we have emphasised is
that <strong>teaching is a skill</strong> - and a complex one at that.
Whether you are new to teaching or skilled in certain methods, adding
new features takes time, effort, and deliberate practice. In this
episode, we will walk through some suggestions about how to prepare
yourself for success in the classroom.</p>
<p>As in other sections, we will not discuss technical preparation.
Carefully reviewing the content of your workshop is important! However,
<strong>it is common for new Instructors to over-prepare on technical
content</strong> – which can be endless! – and under-prepare the
learner-centered elements of their teaching practice. If you encounter
questions that you can’t answer, demonstrating how you Google things may
earn surprisingly positive feedback! In contrast, neglecting to attend
to the audience usually has much more serious consequences for learning
and morale. When you prepare to teach, we therefore suggest setting
aside time <em>before</em> deeply reviewing your technical content to
<strong>plan your approach to instruction</strong>.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>To teach effectively, you have to know <em>who</em> you are teaching.
You may have a broad idea about the type of audience you expect. You may
(we hope!) have a plan to learn a few things about your participants
after a class has begun. However, in thinking about your learners, it is
also important to consider them in a broader context and in a way that
you are not able to fully explore in your classroom. It can be helpful
to reserve time to think through ways in which learners’ experiences and
needs may be similar to or different from your own, or from each
others.</p>

</div>
<p>As you strive to anticipate and understand your audience, it is
useful to recognise that you will never know everything about the
individuals who come into your classroom. You will not be informed about
their hopes and fears beyond what they choose to present. You will never
know the full spectrum of neurodiversity represented in your workshop.
You will not know who is going through a rough break-up, who struggles
with an abusive work environment, who has a sick baby at home, or who
skipped breakfast to save money that morning. What challenges might
affect your imaginary person? Thinking deeply about learners as people
can help you prepare to bring your best self and provide an inclusive
environment for everyone.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>All Carpentries lessons should have learning objectives listed at the
top of each episode. Did you notice these in your lesson? In most cases
they are quite specific about <strong>what a learner should be able to
do</strong> by the end of the episode. This is helpful in both designing
extra formative assessments and in evaluating possible additions or
digressions for appropriateness.</p>
<p>Carpentries learning objectives should target novice learners. This
typically means that the actions specified by the learning objective
should be basic and uncomplicated. These might include words like
“recognise,” “distinguish,” or “use.” They typically do not include
words like “design,” “evaluate,” or “break down” because these imply
more complex cognitive actions even where the focal content is the
same.</p>
<div id="evaluate-learning-objectives" class="callout discussion">
<div class="callout-square">
<i class="callout-icon" data-feather="message-circle"></i>
</div>
<div id="evaluate-learning-objectives" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">Evaluate Learning Objectives</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Select one learning objective from the episode you’ve used for
teaching practice. Copy it into the Etherpad then add numbers below your
objective to address the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Suppose a learner had mastered this objective, and wanted to try
something more cognitively challenging on the exact same topic
(i.e. <strong>not</strong> a next step in a workflow). Identify an
objective they could work towards next.</li>
<li>Suppose a learner struggled to meet the specified objective. What
might they be missing? Identify one more fundamental thing a learner
needs to be able to do in order to be successful in meeting this
objective.</li>
</ol>
<p>This exercise should take about 10 minutes.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Some answers above may include words like “know” and “understand.”
Surely this is the objective of all teaching! However, these terms are
quite difficult to use when it comes time to <em>assess</em> whether a
learner has met that objective. They are also quite ambiguous with
regard to the <em>level</em> of understanding to be achieved. Where you
encounter these, consider how they may be improved by making them
specific to an outcome that is clearly achievable and readily
assessed.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="beware-the-urge-to-complicate">Beware the Urge to Complicate<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#beware-the-urge-to-complicate"></a>
</h3>
<p>When experts teach, they are often eager to advance their learners to
higher cognitive levels where challenges seem more interesting or
valuable. If the learning objectives in your lesson seem a bit dull, you
can understand the appeal! And the goal is laudable. However, teaching
is an incremental process, and giving in to this urge can result in
skipping steps (see “expert awareness gap” in previous episodes),
leaving novice learners in a state of cognitive overload.<br>
‘Higher order’ tasks like synthesis or creation rely on more fundamental
levels of understanding, and are therefore prone to failure when applied
too soon. Awareness of exactly what underlying knowledge is required at
each step will help you to avoid asking too much. For more guidance on
identifying the “level” of a particular task, we recommend having a look
at one of many excellent references on Bloom’s Taxonomy.</p>

<p>When a learning objective has been met, everyone should know about
it! You, as an Instructor, can be satisfied that your teaching has
successfully translated into learning. For learners, recognizing that
they have successfully learned something is motivating and it also
supports their ability to monitor their own progress – this awareness,
or <strong>metacognition</strong>, is especially key to supporting
continued learning beyond the classroom. However, not all lessons have
checkpoints built in where such progress is made clear. Where they do,
they can pass unnoticed in the absence of focused recognition.</p>

<p>Instructors should use a formative assessment ideally every 5 minutes
and at least every 10-15 minutes in order to make sure that the class is
actually learning. Since the average attention span is usually only this
long, formative assessments also help break up instructional time and
re-focus attention. Formative assessments can also be used preemptively:
if you start a class with a question and everyone can answer it
correctly, then you can safely skip the part of the lecture in which you
were going to explain something that your learners already know.</p>

<h3 class="callout-title">“Do You Understand?” is Ineffective as a Formative Assessment</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Learners are often reluctant to admit when they do not understand.
Furthermore, self-assessments of skill in the absence of formative
assessment are often inaccurate because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect" class="external-link">Dunning-Kruger
effect</a>: the less people know about a subject, the less accurate
their estimate of their knowledge is. Therefore, if you ask a room full
of people “Do you understand?” the result will invariably be a number of
‘yes’ responses (many of them inaccurate) which tend to drown out a
variable amount of silence. Instead, a targeted formative assessment
takes the inaccuracy and stress of self-judgement away and demonstrates
to all whether the learners’ level of understanding has met the
instructor’s goal.</p>

<p>Collaborative maintenance of curriculum materials allows The
Carpentries to maintain up-to-date workshops in a rapidly changing
world. We hope you will join in to support our Maintainers in overseeing
this process, and even consider becoming a curriculum Maintainer
yourself! However, there is one down-side to collaborative upkeep:
adding content is a much more fun way to contribute than proposing
content to remove. Every workshop moves at its own pace, but if you are
following our recommendations to <strong>go slowly</strong> and pause
for formative assessment, it is likely that you will have to make cuts
in what you plan to teach. Indeed, despite our best efforts at
maintaining this curriculum, your Instructor Trainers may well have had
to make cuts to make space for great conversations or extra questions in
this training!</p>
<p>There are many ways to make cuts in a workshop, and they can have
variable knock-on effects to watch out for. A little advance planning
goes a long way to avoid making mistakes when you start cutting things
‘on the fly.’</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Keep breaks on time</strong> even if your content is split
awkwardly around them. Delaying breaks can demotivate your audience and
disrupt plans they may make around announced break times.</li>
<li>
<strong>Watch out for dependencies</strong> if you skip a step. It
may not be a step they <em>needed to know</em> about, but it may
generate or re-name a file that is used in later episodes.</li>
<li>
<strong>Leave time to wrap up your workshop</strong> even if this
means cutting even more content. We will talk about this more
shortly.</li>
<li>
<strong>Do not speed up</strong> if you are running behind! All
curricula are freely available so learners can visit content they have
missed; this means there is very little to be gained by “quickly
covering” (but not actually teaching) content.</li>
<li>
<strong>Communicate with your team</strong> about what you plan to
cut, or what you decided to leave out. Do not assume anyone will notice
if you skip something. They may be able to find a way to fit certain
concepts in with later content if they know it has been missed.</li>
<li>
<strong>Communicate with your learners</strong> about where they can
find skipped content and whether any help may be available to support
their independent work. Cutting content may make them feel anxious, but
it will help for them to know how to follow up.</li>

<p>When is the best time to review your post-workshop survey responses
and other feedback that you received during a workshop? We certainly
recommend taking time to do this after a workshop, while your memories
are still fresh. However, we <em>also</em> recommend having a look again
<strong>before you teach your next workshop</strong>. This will help
refresh your memory of all that went well (yay!) as well as challenges
you faced and learners who struggled at certain points. What will you
keep the same, and what will you do differently? Just a few moments of
reflective practice with prior feedback will go a long way towards
building your skill as a teacher and making each workshop you teach

<p>The idea that ten thousand hours of practice will make someone an

Practice is not doing the same thing over and over again: practice is
doing similar but subtly different things, getting feedback, and then
changing behavior in response to that feedback to get cumulatively
better. Doing the same thing over and over again is much more likely to
solidify bad habits than perfect performance. This is why we emphasise
practice and feedback for learners at our workshops and for trainees in
our Instructor Training program.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>One of the greatest strengths of Carpentries workshops compared with
many other instructional settings is that workshops are prepared and
executed by more than one person. We ask that at least two Instructors
teach in every workshop, and some workshops may have many more! During
the workshop, you should also have a crew of Helpers to answer questions
individually, elevate common problems for general discussion, and make
sure the pacing works for everyone.</p>
<p>The people who are planning and executing your workshop with you can
really lighten the load! They are also there to help if you find
yourself in a sticky situation. However, from logistics planning to
delicate problem solving, a little planning goes a long way, and all
co-Instructors should be in agreement about how they will support each
other in engaging challenges. In this episode, we will discuss examples,
strategies, and resources for handling challenges you may face in the
classroom. We will also take some time to discuss planning logistics,
and (time permitting) everyone will have an opportunity to try out our
instructions for setting up a workshop website.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>A typical Carpentries workshop includes 3 roles; sometimes
individuals may choose to play more than one role. Each workshop should
have:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>Host</strong> who organises the workshop logistics</li>
<li>Two or more <strong>Instructors</strong> who plan and execute
workshop instruction</li>
<li>
<strong>Helpers</strong> who support learners during the
workshop</li>
</ul>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="hosting">Hosting<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#hosting"></a>
</h3>
<p>We will not spend a lot of time talking about the host role, because
most of what they do is not directly related to teaching. However, this
is a significant role in any workshop. A suggested checklist for this
role is in <a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/resources/workshops/checklists.html#host-checklist" class="external-link">The
Carpentries Handbook</a>.</p>
<p>When Instructors self-organise a workshop, they sometimes find
themselves playing the role of Host as well as Instructor. We recommend
avoiding this if possible, because hosting responsibilities will
subtract from the time you have to prepare and teach.</p>
<p>If you cannot find someone else to bear full responsibility for the
Host role, consider recruiting help for specific tasks. This may include
involving helpers in advance of the workshop, or exploring institutional
support for event logistics like registration, snack delivery, helper
coordination, and emergency contact.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="instructors-co-teaching-models">Instructors: Co-teaching Models<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#instructors-co-teaching-models"></a>
</h3>
<p><em>Co-teaching</em> describes any situation in which two teachers
work together in the same classroom. There are <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/interactions-collaboration-skills-for-school-professionals/oclc/930364264" class="external-link">many
ways</a> to do this; we use the following methods most frequently:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Team teaching:</strong> Both teachers deliver a single
stream of content in tandem, taking turns the way that musicians taking
solos would.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Teach and assist:</strong> Teacher A teaches while
Teacher B moves around the classroom to help learners.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>“Teach and assist” is most common, in part because people are
accustomed to teaching alone! However, “Team teaching” can be a fun way
to lead together as well. Team teaching can be particularly helpful when
two Instructors have very different strengths, creating a more balanced
experience overall. This may also be worth considering for
self-organised workshops if a co-Instructor has not yet been
certified.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="helpers">Helpers<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#helpers"></a>
</h3>
<p><a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/resources/workshops/checklists.html#helper-checklist" class="external-link">Helpers</a>
are usually recruited from a local community by the Host of a workshop.
Helpers may be involved prior to the day of the workshop, but often they
simply show up. In most cases, helpers are expected to attend for the
full workshop, but in some communities they may come and go during
different segments.</p>
<p>Helpers can assist in a variety of ways. They may:</p>
<ul>
<li>help learners with setup and installation</li>
<li>answer questions during exercises</li>
<li>monitor the room to spot people who may need help (indicated by a
sticky note or otherwise)</li>
<li>monitor the shared notes and either answer questions there or remind
the Instructor to do so during breaks</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to help effectively, helpers need to be onboarded to the
basic elements of Carpentries teaching practices. <a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/resources/workshops/checklists.html#helper-checklist" class="external-link">The
helper checklist</a> includes a short list of “Teaching Rules” that may
be shared with helpers. However, you will also want to make sure they
are informed about key logistics and classroom practices.</p>

However, there are a few teaching practices that are expected in all
Carpentries workshops. These include:</p>

learners should be doing the typing whenever possible.</p>

<div id="learners-use-their-own-machines" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">Learners Use Their Own Machines</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Learners tell us that it is important to them to leave the workshop
with their own machine set up to do real work. We therefore continue to
teach on all three major platforms (Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows), even
though it would be simpler to require learners to use just one.</p>
<p>We have experimented with virtual machines (VMs) on learners’
computers to reduce installation problems, but those introduce problems
of their own: older or smaller machines simply are not fast enough, and
learners often struggle to switch back and forth between two different
sets of keyboard shortcuts for things like copying and pasting.</p>
<p>Some instructors use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server" class="external-link">Virtual
Private Servers</a> (VPS) over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell" class="external-link">Secure Shell</a> (SSH)
or web browser pages instead. This solves the installation issues, but
makes us dependent on host institutions’ WiFi (which can be unreliable),
and has the issues mentioned above with things like keyboard
shortcuts.</p>

<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="sticky-notes">Sticky Notes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sticky-notes"></a>
</h4>
<p>At in-person workshops, two different colours of paper sticky notes
are given to each learner. These act as ‘flags’ that may be placed on a
laptop screen to indicate when a learner needs help or when they have
completed a task and are ready to move on. This is better than having
people raise their hands because:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is more discreet (which means they are more likely to actually do
it),</li>
<li>they can keep working while their flag is raised, and</li>
<li>the instructor can quickly see from the front of the room what state
the class is in.<br><strong>Active and frequent requests</strong> are most effective in
getting learners to actually use these well (e.g. “please put up a blue
sticky note if you completed the last step, and a yellow sticky note if
you need help.”).<br>
In online workshops, Zoom has a green “✓” and red “x” under “reactions”
that may be used in place of sticky notes.</li>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>Once upon a time, Carpentries workshops commonly used red and green
sticky notes because of their common symbolism for “stop” and “go.”
However, we have learned and grown! We strongly encourage you to get
sticky notes in colours other than red and green (e.g. blue and yellow),
because learners, helpers, and Instructors with colourblindness may have
difficulty distinguishing red from green. Some Instructors have also had
great fun with differently-shaped sticky notes (stars and squares,
thumbs up that can be turned into thumbs down stickies etc.).</p>

intensive burst of dedicated time and energy. However, “intensive” is a
key word – two day workshops are intense! In addition to minding your
pacing, it is important to schedule breaks, and to take them on time. In
addition to allowing vital rest and social time, this will also allow
learners to attend to work and personal matters at predictable
times.<br>
At in-person workshops, beverages and snacks to suit a range of dietary
needs are highly recommended. This may mean charging a small fee for
your workshop to cover the cost.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Carpentries workshops target novices, but participants from a variety
of backgrounds and technical skill levels will often sign up for
workshops. Some may be novices in one technology (e.g. git), but
competent or even expert in another (e.g. R). As an Instructor, you will
need to be attentive to this range in your learners’ prior skill level.
“Meeting learners where they are” can seem like an impossible challenge
under these circumstances! But with a solid team approach you will be
surprised at how many people can come away feeling satisfied that their
time was well spent.</p>

<div id="what-are-the-challenges" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">What Are the Challenges?</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>What are some of the challenges you might expect when teaching
learners with a broad range of expertise? Add your thoughts in the
Etherpad.</p>
<p>This discussion should take about 5 minutes.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Here are some strategies Carpentries Instructors have generated to
deal with this issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be sure that workshop <strong>advertisements communicate its level
clearly</strong> by describing not only the topics (e.g. plotting in R),
but also the specific skills and tasks (i.e. the learning objectives).
If advanced learners do sign up anyway (and they may!), this will be an
informed choice.</li>
<li>Consider creating <strong>“beginner” and “advanced” options</strong>
for exercises. Learners who finish the “beginner” exercise can then
challenge themselves with a next step.</li>
<li>During class, <strong>encourage learners to help others</strong>
nearby when they feel comfortable doing so. Teaching is a great way to
level up learning (one of many reasons why Carpentries Instructors
choose to teach!). Note that you will need an icebreaker before most
learners will take this advice.</li>
<li>
<strong>Do not let advanced learners take over the
conversation</strong> during class, no matter how interesting it may be.
This can alienate novices and consumes precious time. Advanced questions
and comments can be politely reserved for breaks, addressed individually
by helpers or the co-Instructor, or typed in the Etherpad for present or
future follow-up.</li>
<li>The helpers and non-teaching co-Instructor(s) should <strong>be
vigilant for learners who are falling behind</strong> and intervene
early so that they do not become frustrated and give up. Frequent
reminders to put up sticky notes for “ok” or “I’m stuck” will support
your team in targeting problems in time.</li>
</ul>
<p>No class can possibly meet all individual training needs. However, it
is entirely possible for total beginners and advanced learners to come
away happy from the same workshop. Beginners may not yet feel competent,
but they may build a mental model of the domain and develop confidence
that they <em>can</em> learn these skills because they have successfully
walked through them. Advanced learners may enjoy picking up “tips and
tricks” or having their own self-taught approaches validated. They may
also enjoy connecting with your workshop community, and might consider
becoming Carpentries Instructors themselves!</p>
<p>Dealing effectively with different skill levels does take some
planning. However, with appropriate advertising and team cohesion on
priorities and strategies, your workshop can be a worthwhile experience
for everyone.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>As discussed in an <a href="09-eia.html">earlier episode</a>, the
Carpentries uses a Code of Conduct as a tool to create an explicitly
inclusive learning environment. This works well! But while the Code of
Conduct may deter some kinds of bad behavior, any public event carries a
risk that someone will say or do something that causes harm.</p>
<p>A critical function of the Code of Conduct is to ensure that our
community does not tolerate or encourage the persistence of harmful
behaviors. In order for the code to work well, <strong>incidents must be
reported</strong>. Note that it is not the responsibility of the
reporter to determine whether a Code of Conduct violation has occurred;
when in doubt, it is best to report an incident and allow the Code of
Conduct Committee to make that determination.</p>
<p>Rarely, your instructional team may encounter a Code of Conduct
violation during a workshop. In addition to reporting this incident, you
will need to decide how and when to respond in the moment. While any
individual may take it upon themselves to respond, team coordination can
both lighten the load and improve the outcome. We encourage you to
<strong>discuss an approach to managing Code of Conduct violations with
your instructional team in advance</strong>.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Code of Conduct violations have been extremely rare in
our community. We think that this is because emphasizing our values up
front really does make a difference.</p>
<p>We hope that this preliminary introduction will help you work with
your team to decide on a response in case you encounter a violation, and
will support you in reporting incidents to prevent their recurrence.
Thorough preparation to manage a difficult situation is useful for any
leadership role, but is beyond the scope of this training event. Follow

<p>While all Carpentries-branded workshops fall under The Carpentries
Code of Conduct, they are also subject to laws, policies, and guidelines

<p>Planning a workshop can be at least as much fun as teaching one. Why?
Because this is the stage at which you get to connect with the amazing
people on your instructional team! One reason why people love the
training you are taking right now is because they get to meet other
Carpentries trainees – people with shared interests and enthusiasm for
sharing technical skills. Yes, there is work to do when planning a
workshop! But there is much to be gained in sharing the process.</p>

<div class="accordion-body">
<ul>
<li>Coordinate who is teaching what, sufficiently in advance that both
instructors are confident in their preparation.</li>
<li>Coordinate with your instructional team. Hosts will need information
from you to advertise the workshop. Helpers will need to know what you
expect from them. More communication is better, but it is also important
to respect people’s time.</li>
<li>If you have time to do some advance preparation together, try
drawing a concept map together or teaching a short snippet of the
lessons for each other.</li>
<li>Discuss in advance if you will provide feedback to each other and
how to do so (see notes above).</li>
<li>If it will not cause cognitive overload for you (the instructors),
work out a couple of hand signals to communicate. “You are going too
fast”, “speak up”, “that learner needs help”, and, “It is time for a
bathroom break” are all useful.</li>
<li>The person who is not teaching should not interrupt, offer
corrections, elaborations, or amusing personal anecdotes, or do anything
else to distract from what the person teaching at the time is doing or
saying. The one exception is that it is sometimes helpful to ask leading
questions, particularly if the learners seem unsure of themselves.</li>
<li>For Carpentries workshops, a single instructor usually teaches for a
half-day stretch (2-3 hours). You can alternate more frequently, but
each person should teach for at least 10-15 minutes at a stretch, since
learners may be distracted by more frequent interleaving.</li>
<li>Each person should take a couple of minutes before they start
teaching to see what their partner is going to teach after they are
done. This allows each instructor to set up their partner’s material
without covering it themselves.</li>
<li>Whenever possible, the person who is not teaching should stay
engaged with the class. Monitor the shared notes, keep an eye on the
learners to see who is struggling, jot down some feedback to give your
teaching partner at the next break - anything that contributes to the
lesson is better than anything that does not. It is easier for the other
instructor to take a break to catch up on outside work (like email) if
there are at least three instructors or sufficient helpers to make sure
that the main instructor is supported.</li>
</ul>

<p>In teaching as in life, shared misery is lessened and shared joy
increased; take a few minutes when the class is over to either
congratulate or commiserate with each other. In that moment, no-one will
better understand how pleased you are at helping someone understand how
loops work, or how disappointed you are that you just could not get
software to install on that one learner’s laptop, than the person you
just taught with.</p>

<li>Add your questions and thoughts on this process to the Etherpad. If
you created a workshop website, add the link there as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>This exercise should take about 15 minutes.</p>
<p>*Note: Sometimes web browsers will cache the workshop webpage, so
when you make changes in GitHub, they do not show up on the workshop
webpage immediately. Two ways to avoid this are to use a “private” or
“incognito” mode in your web browser or by following these instructions
to bypass your browser cache: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bypass_your_cache" class="external-link">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bypass_your_cache</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>You may also wish to create an Etherpad for your workshop (or other
Carpentries-related event), preferably using the same workshop id used
when creating the workshop website. When you point a browser to a url at
<code>https://pad.carpentries.org/workshop-id</code> (e.g.,
<code>https://pad.carpentries.org/2022-02-22-berlin</code>) you will
either arrive at an existing Etherpad by that name or a brand new
Etherpad with basic Carpentries information at the top.</p>
<p>Note that there are pros and cons to using Etherpad. Pads do
occasionally freeze or crash, so we recommend creating a backup copy.
Otherwise, Etherpads persist indefinitely, so they may be used for
further reference after a workshop.</p>

<p>When preparing to teach a workshop, it is normal to focus on the
content. We hope that our discussions so far have also encouraged you to
prepare your delivery, creating plans to listen and respond to learners
during a workshop. But within that, there are two time points that make
a big difference to a workshop experience: the introduction and the
conclusion.</p>
<p>Because these take time away from content instruction, it can be
tempting to avoid investing precious preparation and class time to these
sections. However, a strong introduction sets the tone for your
workshop, teaches learners how to engage, and inspires confidence that
learners will get what they need. A solid conclusion helps learners to
solidify what they have learned and plan their next steps, and sends
everyone – including Instructors and Helpers – home with a sense of
accomplishment. In this section, we will work together to identify
ingredients that can make these moments stand out and dedicate some
practice time as well.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Take a moment to think back to a course or workshop you really liked,
think about how it began. Your impression on the first day of a course
probably matched that of the rest of the course. It also probably stands
out in your memory far more than the rest of the course! This is due to
a feature of memory known as the <strong>primacy effect</strong>.
Opening experiences make a difference in the short and long term –
introductions set the tone for the workshop and the path for
learning.</p>
<p>Introducing a workshop is an exciting and empowering moment! It can
also be intimidating. Having a plan helps relieve stress and get you
started. Even in the face of early technical issues (which is common at
the start of a workshop), you can have a chance to reset with something

<p>It can feel like the Introduction is “just” something you have to get
through in order to get started on the “real” workshop content. But,
chances are that many of the goals you identified in the activity above
involved <em>teaching</em> information or procedures that you want
learners to know, or <em>learning</em> things about your audience. This
means that everything you have learned about teaching and learning
applies here, too. Short term memory? Check! Cognitive overload?
Check!</p>
<p>Learning objectives usually omit introductory content – after all,
these do not typically relate to our long term goals. The content of the
introduction may not even be relevant once the workshop has finished!
But if we did include the Introduction, what would those learning
objectives look like?</p>
<p>After the introduction learners should:</p>
<ul>
<li>be able to predict the type of instruction</li>
<li>know what will be taught</li>
<li>understand what will be required of them</li>
<li>believe that they can learn from the workshop</li>
<li>be aware of the schedule</li>
</ul>
<p>The instructional team should:</p>
<ul>
<li>know who is participating in the workshop and what their
expectations are</li>
<li>have an initial impression of how learners respond to participation
prompts and what will be needed to encourage them to engage</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="setting-the-stage">Setting the Stage<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#setting-the-stage"></a>
</h3>
<p>These objectives can be met in many ways; many of them can be
addressed at the same time. As you consider the approach you will take,
take a step back to consider the big picture. How will learners perceive
your classroom environment? A few things to pay attention to as you
include:</p>
<p><strong>Your attire.</strong> This is one of those things that
“should not matter” but, in reality, clothing has a powerful influence
on perceptions of everything from credibility to kindness. Be
comfortable, be intentional, and convey what you want to communicate.
(Also, check the weather, and make no assumptions about thermostats in
an unfamiliar classroom!)</p>
<p><strong>The physical environment</strong>. Are you in a small
classroom or a large, impersonal lecture hall? How are the seats
arranged? Physical features may be beyond your control, but they still
contribute to your learner’s impressions. How can you help? (Note: if
you are in an online environment, structural features can also impact
your workshop experience! What are those features, and how can you
modify or moderate their impact?)</p>
<p><strong>Your use of the few minutes before class.</strong> Is the
instructional team present and welcoming, or rushing in frantically to a
waiting crowd?</p>
<p><strong>Your introduction of yourself.</strong> Planning this out can
help you be intentional about what to include – and what not to! A few
things you may want to convey include</p>
<ul>
<li>your experience or related areas of work</li>
<li>how formal/informal you want to be</li>
<li>how available you will be to the learners</li>
<li>your enthusiasm for the subject</li>
<li>your motivations for teaching</li>

<h3 class="callout-title">Introductions for Everyone</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>If you’re teaching a typical Carpentries workshop, then you are
probably not teaching alone! Make sure that everyone involved in the
workshop - instructors, helpers, organisers - has a chance to introduce
themselves at some point. If you spread out introductions across
sections or have people coming and going, it helps to build in a
reminder to create time later on.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Your doubts.</strong> Sometimes if you have doubts about how
the workshop will go, either because you are new to teaching or because
you are aware of potential problems, this may come across (intentionally
or unintentionally) during your introduction. Sharing such
vulnerabilities judiciously can help keep learners on your side when
problems do arise. However, there is also a risk of undermining learner
confidence. Thinking this through in advance can keep you from
oversharing in a moment of anxiety!</p>
<p><strong>The classroom community.</strong> Becoming familiar with
other participants helps learners relax and engage, breaking down fear
and supporting a sense of belonging. Icebreakers can seem silly and they
do take time, but even a lightweight activity makes a big difference.
This also sets the tone for an active workshop, which can be especially
important if your curriculum does not offer early opportunities for
interaction.</p>

<p>Here is one example of an icebreaker you can use: Have everyone turn
to a partner and introduce themselves with their name, one word about
their research (e.g.’microbes’, ‘dogs’, ‘vectors’, ‘stars’) and a thing
they are proud of that they made.</p>

<p>Clearly establishing expectations at the outset orients learners to
participate actively and helps them use their time productively. Keep in
mind that critical information will need to be communicated more than
once! This information should also be present in your workshop
documentation and/or collaborative notes.</p>
<p><strong>Describe the prerequisites</strong> (if any).</p>
<p><strong>Share the schedule and logistics.</strong> Post lunch and
break times, and stick to them! Share bathroom &amp; lactation room
locations and any other instructions specific to your workshop.
Demonstrating a commitment to accessibility at this point will help
learners feel more comfortable making additional requests as needed.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate the workshop structure</strong>, including
learning objectives and hands-on approach. If your instructional team
has distinct roles in the workshop (e.g. “notetaker” vs “roaming
helper”), be sure to introduce them, too.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate your expectations</strong> for learners,
including:</p>
<ul>
<li>how to follow the <a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/policies/coc/" class="external-link">Code of
Conduct</a>
</li>
<li>ways to ask for help</li>
<li>ways to give feedback to the instructional team</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Collect and share baseline data on learners</strong>. If you
are teaching an official Carpentries workshop, you should have received
the results of your pre-assessment surveys -- these can be helpful in
planning your workshop! Even so, you may have additional questions, and
there will always be learners who did not fill out the survey. Sharing
and discussing these data with learners can help to combat imposter
syndrome and let them know that they are welcome ‘as they are’.</p>
<p><strong>Share some advice for success</strong> – including your
confidence that they can do it! If you have a range of skill
backgrounds, this is a good opportunity to offer differentiated advice
on how to make the most of the experience, e.g. suggesting that
intermediate learners build their skills by helping a neighbour or
considering more advanced questions to be discussed during the
breaks.</p>
<p><strong>Whet learners’ appetites for workshop content</strong>. In
most cases, your learners chose to attend this workshop, but they may
yet be unclear on whether it will be worthwhile. This is a great chance
to get them excited about the prospect of learning what you have to
teach!</p>

<p>Your workshop almost certainly had some highs and lows. If you
followed our advice about going slowly, it is also likely that you will
be pressed for time at the end! Out of respect for all involved, it is
important that you end your workshop on time. Even if you have not met
your content goals, there are far more valuable ways to spend the last
15-20 minutes of a course than squeezing in one last command or bit of
advice.</p>

use the last few minutes in another way.</p>
<p>In the Etherpad, write down one thing you could do at the end of a
workshop. What is the value of spending time on that thing? If you have
time after writing down your idea, read through the others in the
Etherpad. If you have another idea that has not been written down yet,
add it to the list.</p>

<li>Close and save files. Where can those files be found, and how can
learners pick up independently where you left off?</li>
<li>Reflect on learning. This can help learners to solidify key concepts
they have learned, making them easier to remember. It may also flush out
a few last questions.</li>
<li>Plan next steps. Does the local community have resources to support
continued learning? Do you have advice for how learners might continue
on their own? Even if you have no advice, asking learners to take a
moment to discuss their own plans can support them in taking a next step
sooner rather than later.</li>
<li>Reiterate where the lesson materials can be found, and encourage
them to apply at least one of the skills to their own work within the
next few days. Potential examples include:
<ul>
<li>Use R to reproduce an analysis that was previously done with a
spreadsheet application;</li>
<li>Write a lab notebook entry in R-markdown;</li>
<li>Backup a thesis or manuscript by storing it on a remote server with

<li>Collect feedback. Minute cards, one-up-one-down, and making time for

<li>Check with the workshop host to see if they have any closing words

<p>We are almost done with our training! At this point, we have covered
many, many topics around teaching and learning, especially in the
context of Carpentries workshops.</p>
<p>Carpentries instructors use a set of teaching techniques based on
evidence from educational research. We have talked about some of these
techniques explicitly (e.g. participatory live coding and formative
assessment), and others we have been modeling throughout the training,
without necessarily calling attention to what we were doing. Some of
these teaching techniques are implemented at particular points in a
workshop, while others are used throughout. Let us put together
everything we have learned and organise these practices in terms of what
parts of a workshop we need to be conscious of each of these strategies.
In other words, let us put down on paper some of our mental model about
teaching and learning, specifically in the Carpentries context.</p>

<p>While there are many ways to think about the practice of teaching, we
hope that this training has provided a model of teaching that is
<strong>learner-centered</strong>. In other words, teaching is not
really about the teacher, but the learners! The more we know about
learners’ backgrounds, motivations, and how they learn (educational
psychology) and what interventions can address these issues, the more
effective our teaching can be. This also means that our model of
teaching does not mean you need to be an expert in the content you are
teaching or that you have to have a certain kind of personality – ANYONE
can learn, practice and improve their teaching, as with any skill.</p>
