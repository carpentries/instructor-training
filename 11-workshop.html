<h2 id="make-a-screencast-before-the-workshop">1. Make a Screencast Before the Workshop</h2>
<p>There should be a pre-defined set of lessons for making screencasts. They should all come from the Software Carpentry core. The trainees could only pick a topic from this set.</p>
<p>Reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>helps the trainees make up their mind;</p></li>
<li><p>it is about seeing oneself teach but also they are supposed to teach SWC so the topic <em>should</em> be from SWC;</p></li>
<li><p>the screencasts may be compared (if the participants want to do it --- it would be a voluntary step).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>After the screencasts are done and the participants received the feedback from the other two from the group, they could be regrouped based on the choice of the topic they decided to teach. That is those who made a screencast on &quot;Loops in Python&quot; would get together and so on. They don't have to watch their videos (in fact there is no time for that) but discuss their experience and the feedback they received. They could also compare their strategies and approaches to teaching the topic.</p>
<p>The set of topics should be send a few days before and the participants should be reminded that they will have to record themselves.</p>
<p>Reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>in Toronto some people didn't have enough time to prepare overnight for making the screencast;</p></li>
<li><p>some participants said they would have brought better recording devices.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="observe-the-instructor-teach-a-module-from-the-swc-core">2. Observe the Instructor Teach a Module from the SWC Core</h2>
<p>The trainees act as students. The instructor teachers a part of a selected module from the SWC core (for example, something like head and tail from the shell lecture). The teaching itself would be 10-15 mins. 3-4 trainees could be helpers (or the instructors present at the training would be helpers).</p>
<p>All trainees have feedback forms which they fill in. Once the teaching is finished, there is a group discussion on what was good, what was bad, which teaching approaches and tricks the trainees picked up. More importantly, they learn how to give feedback on teaching.</p>
<h2 id="multiple-choice-questions-with-distractors">3. Multiple Choice Questions With Distractors</h2>
<p>The main goal of this task is to develop ways of analyzing the potential misconceptions students may have about a given topic. This task will also teach instructors to become more aware of how they themselves may induce such misconceptions.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Trainees are divided into groups of three. Each group comes up with three questions and four answers to each question. The incorrect answers should be ones that students may arrive at as the result of specific misunderstandings or misconceptions about the material. Trainees should be able to explain how students would arrive at these incorrect answers.</p></li>
<li><p>The groups then exchange questions and answers, without revealing the correct answer or how they anticipate students would arrive at the incorrect answers. The group reading the question must then determine the correct answer and explain how students would arrive at the incorrect answers.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This exercise will allow the group that wrote the question to see whether they were able to accurately &quot;simulate&quot; a hypothetical student's mind and anticipate possible misconceptions and misunderstandings. Having groups attempt to explain how a student would arrive at an incorrect answer written by another group results in a more realistic exercise.</p>
<h2 id="strategies-for-preparing-to-teach-unfamiliar-material">4. Strategies for Preparing to Teach Unfamiliar Material</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Come clean - tell the hosts, the administator and the other instructor which module(s) you would rather not teach because you are still not very confident with the material.</p></li>
<li><p>Negotiate with the other instructor splitting the material so that each one of you teaches the bit that you know/are comfortable with.</p></li>
<li><p>Train yourself up! Go through the whole material of a given module and learn it; write down all bits that you don't understand. Then go through it again, as if you were teaching --- this will reveal even more bits of material that you don't quite get! Are you really sure what happens in Git when you create a branch?</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>TIP: It will take you 3-4 times longer than you estimate to prepare for teaching material that you are not familiar with or that you have never taught before.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Being a Lead Instructor</li>
</ol>
<p>&quot;It sounds more scary than it really is.&quot; The goal of this session is to make the trainees more comfortable with the responsibilities and the work of the lead instructors; and to make them ready for this role.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Trainees read through the section on the website on &quot;how to be a lead instructor&quot; (this could be a homework to be done in the evening of Day 1 or even sent out earlier).</p></li>
<li><p>They write down things that they:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>don't understand / don't know how to do; or</p></li>
<li><p>think they will struggle with.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Then they work in groups of 3-4. Each person picks one thing from the above two lists (so two issues) and the group tries to find answers/solutions to them.</p></li>
<li><p>The instructor talks about the &quot;mentorship&quot; - where/how to get help from more experienced instructors who have been leads several times.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="creating-a-bootcamp-repository-and-web-site">6. Creating a Bootcamp Repository and Web Site</h2>
<p>This task is to simulate what normally a lead instructor has to do, how long it takes, identify what problems they may face (both technical, like needing help with Git, and contents, like needing to liaise with hosts to get info about venue and hours). They will also (hopefully) see that it's not that scary. And even if we change the whole structure, they will have more confidence they can do it. Also, they should be encouraged to provide feedback (PRs!) on the instructions written for setting up a repo, find bugs etc.</p>
<p>This could be homework after Day1, or homework after the Train the Trainers event.</p>
<h2 id="how-not-to-teach">7. How Not to Teach</h2>
<p>The goal of this session is to make the trainees aware what kinds of their behaviour, wording, style of teaching may cause more damage than good.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Telling students that they are doing &quot;rubbish work&quot; because they use Excel, Word; they don't modularise their code; don't test it etc. etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Perpetually complaining about Windows/Mac and praising Linux/Unix - juxtaposing the former as &quot;for amateurs/not real OS/broken OS&quot; with the latter (&quot;for professionals/for <em>real</em> geeks/for real,serious tasks&quot;)</p></li>
<li><p>Criticizing GUI appications and describing command-line tools as &quot;the only ones that do the job&quot;. Even worse, an instructor putiing himself/herself in a position of a &quot;guru&quot;: &quot;I'm a real programmer; don't know anything about that silly Windows stuff.&quot; By doing this you intimidate the students. Many of them have already been intimidated and came to SWC hoping to get help.</p></li>
<li><p>Not managing expectations. Start with the hosts when you negotiate the curriculum. Make sure that they understand the main goals and purpose of SWC (we target beginners; it's not about the intrisics of object oriented programming). It's usually the leading instructors job but the SWC admin may be able to help you, if the hosts don't seem to be getting the message through. It is really crucial to make it clear to them because it's them who will be advertising/recommenting SWC workshop to the students. If they misadvertise it, you may end up with an audience who will be very disappointed they are taught how to modularise their code whilst they actually wanted to learn some MPI (&quot;I thought it was supposed to be about scientific programming!&quot;). Once you sorted the hosts, you should still make it clear to the attendees at the beginning of Day 1 what you and the other instructor will be doing over the course of the following two days and why you do it this way.</p></li>
<li><p>Diving into discussing really complex and difficult questions asked by 1-2 people in the audience who clearly don't really need SWC. They already know it all and want to discuss whether Scala is better than Haskell. If you, as an instructor, engage in these questions because you feel they are far more interesting than teaching how to create functions in Python, you probably should not be an SWC instructor. If teaching beginners is <em>boring</em> for you and you'd rather have advanced discussions, instructing at SWC workshops is probably not be best way you could contribute to SWC. Maybe you'd be interested in debugging a number of srcipts which help to run our infrastructure? Or help with the admintool?</p></li>
<li><p>Hide your impostor syndrome. If you suffer from the impostor syndrome, learn how to use it to your advantage. Remember that SWC's main goal is to help people who need to improve relatively basic software engineering and development skills (though their research/domain knowledge is probably very good). They will feel more at ease if you aren't afraid to admit that you don't think you're an expert on a given topic. But don't overdo it - you don't want to give an impression that SWC instructors know nothing about computers. We at least know how to switch them on.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-to-help-swc-grow">8. How to Help SWC Grow</h2>
<p>At the beginning and at the end of each workshop encourage the attendees and helpers to get engaged in Software Carpentry. Have a slide ready showing different ways to engage and the path: attendee -&gt; helper -&gt; instructor. Have the information ready about the instructors training and point people to the right website (http://teaching.software-carpentry.org). Make sure that you challenge the misconception that an SWC instructor must be an experienced software developer with a degree in Computer Science. Give examples of some of the instructors who are just like the members of the audience.</p>
<h2 id="code-of-conduct">9. Code of Conduct</h2>
<p>Make sure everyone understands what it is, where it is, and that compliance is not optional.</p>
<h2 id="dealing-with-audiences-with-varying-knowledge-and-skills">10. Dealing With Audiences With Varying Knowledge and Skills</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Get the smart ones to be helpers. Occassionally, in collaboration with the hosts (of they know the audience very very well), you may be able to pair people up so that the beginners sit together with a more advanced person.</p></li>
<li><p>Manage expectations (see 7.d).</p></li>
