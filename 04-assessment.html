          <p>Any adaptive process requires observations to adapt to - so, we need effective tools to observe &amp; assess student understanding. Student assessment is commonly grouped into two gross categories: <em>summative</em>, and <em>formative</em>.</p>
          <p><strong>Summative Assessment</strong> is intended to measure learning outcomes; the canonical example is the final exam. A well-designed summative assessment should reveal how well students have met the design goals of a course or lesson, as laid out in the first step of reverse instructional design; its principle use is for deciding if the course as a whole was successful.</p>
          <p><strong>Formative Assessment</strong> is intended to measure student understanding or ability in situ during a course, in order to adapt the course on the fly to optimise the efficacy of that course.</p>
          <p>Superficially, these sound pretty similar, up to when exactly they are administered; they both assess student understanding &amp; performance. The key difference between the two is <em>resolution</em>; in essence, summative assessment is only required to provide a simple up or down indicator of whether a course did its job or not; but formative assessment has to not only flag gaps in student performance, but resolve <em>why and how</em> students are missing the mark, in order to optimally inform instructional course correction.</p>
          <p>Institutional Western education has converged largely on summative assessment - principally because it's cheaper and easier. Summative assessment can be actualized in standardized testing, which can be administered uniformly at scale, with minimal interruption to already cramped classroom time, and responded to off line in future iterations of a course, as planning time and budget permit. But formative assessment is far more personal, deeper, and operational in real-time; it must be conducted on a per-classroom basis, typically during class time, and appropriate course corrections must be available at the instructor's fingertips. The scale that leads to summative assessment's efficiency is also its greatest weakness; differences between individual classes and cohorts get washed out, and adaptation is slow and can only converge toward a global mean. Formative assessment, though more labor intensive, is also far more nimble.</p>
          <p>Time is at a premium in the workshop environment. Taking time out to administer lengthy summative exams or in-depth formative investigations of student performance isn't feasible; we want the adaptivity aspired to by formative assessment, in exercises that take a few minutes.</p>
          <p>Multiple Choice Questions provide an excellent assessment device for balancing time investment with depth of scrutiny; <a href="http://mozillascience.github.io/instructorTraining/designAndAdaptation/assessment_01.html">the following exercise</a> goes through their construction and use.</p>
          <p>So - you've just administered a quick formative multiple choice question, and the majority of your students are quite convinced that 37+25 = 512; what now? Formative assessment has zeroed in on a misconception; armed with that knowledge, what are some strategies for correcting the problem?</p>
          <p>This is one place a densely connected concept map comes in handy. Presumably the first time you taught the misbegotten concept, it was introduced as a node on a concept map connected to some pre-existing scaffolding the students were comfortable with. Perhaps the connection originally explored was more obvious to some students than others; coming at the concept again from a different connection will reinforce the understanding of those that already get it, and give those struggling another run at it. If addition fell flat as a powered-up version of counting, re-examine number representation and the meaning of places and digits, for example.</p>
          <p>Repeating nearly identical examples that follow the same lines of reasoning, on the other hand, not only adds little to the conversation, but runs the risk of being counterproductive, by reasserting the confusion that lead to misconception in the first place, thus potentially cementing it even further. The trouble being, that even the most creative instructor eventually runs out of ways to explain the same idea. How can we create a learning environment that's even more adaptive than we are?</p>
