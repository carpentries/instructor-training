## Application form

Make sure that you have filled out the Carpentries 
[instructor application form](https://amy.software-carpentry.org/forms/request_training/). 
We can not track your progress and make you an official instructor without it. If you have already
filled out this form, you do not need to submit another application.

## Instructor Checkout

As you read in your homework last night, the final three steps in qualifying as an instructor are to:

1.  Make a contribution to a lesson's content, exercises, or instructor notes by doing **one** of the following:
    1.  Submit a change (i.e. pull request) to fix an existing issue.
    2.  Proof-read a lesson and add a new issue describing something to be improved.
    3.  Provide substantive feedback on an existing issue or pull request.
2.  Take part in a [discussion session][discussion] with experienced instructors.
3.  Prepare to teach a full Carpentries lesson (i.e. the content of one lesson repository). Then perform a 5-minute [live coding demo][demo] for that lesson starting at a point chosen by the session lead.

[This page]({{ page.root }}/checkout/) explains the procedure in detail. 
There's also a [helpful checklist](http://www.datacarpentry.org/checkout/) 
if you'd prefer a brief summary.
