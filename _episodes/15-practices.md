We regard teaching as a performance art,
no different from drama, music, or athletics.
And as in those fields,
we have a collection of small tips and tricks to make teaching work better.

## Challenges

With live coding, it is easy for some learners to fall behind, and for other
learners to get bored.  Given the diversity of our learners' backgrounds and skills, we will
always have a mix of more and less advanced people in our classes.  No
matter what we teach, and how fast or how slow we go, 20% or more of
the room will be lost, and there's a good chance that a different 20%
will be bored.

The obvious solution is to split people by level,
but if we ask them how much they know about particular things,
they regularly under- or over-estimate their knowledge.
We have therefore developed a short pre-assessment questionnaire
that asks them how easily they could do a small number of specific tasks.
It gives instructors some idea of who they're going to be helping,
but we have not validated the questions,
i.e.,
we have not done the laborious work of interviewing respondents
to ensure that they are interpreting the questions the same way that we are.
We also have not yet done the follow-up to see
whether the questionnaires' categorization of learners
matches their actual in-class proficiency.

That said, there *are* things we can do:

*   Before running a workshop,
    communicate its level clearly to everyone who's thinking of signing up
    by listing the topics that will be covered
    and showing a few examples of exercises that people will be asked to complete.
*   Provide multiple exercises for each teaching episode
    so that more advanced learners don't finish early and get bored.
*   Ask more advanced learners to help people next to them.
    They'll learn from answering their peers' questions
    (since it will force them to think about things in new ways).
*   The helpers and the instructor who isn't teaching the particular episode
    should keep an eye out for learners who are falling behind
    and intervene early
    so that they don't become frustrated and give up.

The most important thing is to accept that
no class can possibly meet everyone's individual needs.
If the instructor slows down to accommodate two people who are struggling,
the other 38 are not being well served.
Equally,
if she spends a few minutes talking about an advanced topic because two learners are bored,
the 38 who don't understand it will feel left out.
All we can do is tell our learners what we're doing and why,
and hope that they'll understand.

## Other Practices

Sticky notes.
:   We give each learner two sticky notes of different colors,
    e.g., red and green.
    These can be held up for voting,
    but their real use is as status flags.
    If someone has completed an exercise and wants it checked,
    they put the green sticky note on their laptop;
    if they run into a problem and need help,
    the put up the red one.
    This is better than having people raise their hands because:

    *    it's more discreet (which means they're more likely to actually do it),
    *    they can keep working while their flag is raised, and
    *    the instructor can quickly see from the front of the room
         what state the class is in.

Minute cards.
:   As explained [yesterday]({{ page.root }}/06-summarize/), we also
    use sticky notes as minute cards: before each coffee or meal break,
    learners take a minute to write one positive thing on the green
    sticky note (e.g., one thing they've learned that they think will
    be useful), and one thing they found too fast, too slow,
    confusing, or irrelevant on the red one.  They can use the red
    sticky note for questions that haven't yet been answered.  It only
    takes a few minutes to cluster these, and allows the instructors
    to adjust to learners' interests and speed.

One up, one down.
:   We frequently also ask for summary feedback at the end of each day.
    The instructors ask the learners to alternately give one positive and
    one negative point about the day, without repeating anything that has
    already been said.  This requirement forces people to say things they
    otherwise might not: once all the "safe" feedback has been given,
    participants will start saying what they really think.

    Minute cards are anonymous; the alternating up-and-down feedback is
    not.  Each mode has its strengths and weaknesses, and by providing
    both, we hope to get the best of both worlds.

Learners use their own machines.
:   Learners tell us that it is important to them to leave the workshop
    with their own machine set up to do real work.  We therefore continue
    to teach on all three major platforms (Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows),
    even though it would be simpler to require learners to use just one.

    We have experimented with virtual machines (VMs) on learners'
    computers to reduce installation problems, but those introduce
    problems of their own: older or smaller machines simply aren't fast
    enough, and learners often struggle to switch back and forth between
    two different sets of keyboard shortcuts for things like copying and
    pasting.

    Some instructors use [Virtual Private Servers][vps] (VPS) over [Secure 
    Shell][ssh] (SSH) or web browser pages instead. This solve the installation 
    issues, but makes us dependent on host institutions' WiFi (which can be 
    of highly variable quality), and has the issues mentioned above with things 
    like keyboard shortcuts.

Collaborative note-taking.
:   We often use [Etherpad][etherpad] for collaborative
    note-taking and to share snippets of code and small data files with
    learners. (If nothing else, it saves us from having to ask students to
    copy long URLs from the presenter's screen to their computers.) It is
    almost always mentioned positively in post-workshop feedback, and
    several workshop participants have started using it in their own
    teaching.

    One of the advantages of collaborative note-taking is that
    it gives the more advanced learners in the class something useful to do.
    Another is that the notes the learners take are usually more helpful *to them*
    than those the instructor would prepare in advance,
    since the learners are more likely to write down what they actually found new,
    rather than what the instructor predicted would be new.
    Finally,
    scanning the Etherpad is a good way for an instructor to discover that
    the class didn't hear something important,
    or misunderstood it.

Pair programming.
:   Pairing is a good practice in real life, and also
    [a good way to teach]({{ page.root }}/files/papers/porter-what-works-2013.pdf).
    Partners can not only help each other out during the practical,
    but can also clarify each other's misconceptions when the solution is
    presented, and discuss common research interests during breaks. To
    facilitate this, we strongly prefer flat (dinner-style) seating to
    banked (theater-style) seating; this also makes it easier for helpers
    to reach learners who need assistance.

    When pair programming is used it's important to put *everyone* in pairs,
    not just the learners who are struggling,
    so that no one feels singled out.
    It's also useful to have people sit in new places (and hence pair with different partners)
    after each coffee or meal break.

Peak rule.
:   The [peak rule][wikipedia-peak-rule] states that
    people judge an experience primarily based on how they felt at its most intense point
    and how they felt at its end.
    While it has been criticized for not strongly predicting what's remembered,
    it's always worth trying to end a lesson on a high note.

Instructor notes.
:   Many of the Software and Data Carpentry lessons have 
    instructor's notes, with information 
    from instructors who have already taught the material.  This can be a valuable 
    resource when preparing lessons, especially when teaching a lesson for the first time.  
    The Software Carpentry instructor guides are linked on each lesson page; the 
    instructor guides for Data Carpentry lessons are on 
    their [main lesson page]({{ site.dc_site }}/lessons/).  

## The Code of Conduct

Beyond the teaching practices and philosophies found in Software and Data 
Carpentry workshops, one of the most important characteristics of our workshops 
is that they be welcoming and safe spaces.  Programming, or data management are 
scary topics to novices, and workshops are meant to be a judgment free 
space to learn and experiment.  The behavior of the instructor and other partipants 
may make more of an impression on a novice learner than any "technical" topic you teach.  

To support this mission
Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry have a shared code of conduct
(online [here]({{ site.swc_site }}/conduct/) and [here]({{ site.dc_site }}/code-of-conduct/))
and participants in our workshops are required to abide by it.
Hosts *must* point people at it during registration,
and instructors *must* remind attendees of it at the start of the workshop.
The Code of Conduct doesn't just tell everyone what the rules are:
it tells them that there *are* rules,
and that they can therefore expect a safe and welcoming learning experience.

What's the purpose of a Code of Conduct?
:   A Code of Conduct cannot stop people from being offensive, any more
    than laws against theft stop people from stealing.  What the CoC
    *can* do is make expectations and consequences clear.

Do workshop participants ever actually violate the Code of Conduct?
:   Very rarely, but it has happened.

But what about free speech?
:   People are free to say what they want, but that doesn't mean they
    are free to say it in our workshops.  As in any classroom, the
    instructor has the right to sanction students who are being
    disruptive.

What should I do if someone violates the Code of Conduct?

:   If you are an instructor, and believe that someone in a workshop has
    violated the Code of Conduct, you may warn them, ask them to
    apologize, and/or expel them, depending on the severity of the
    violation and whether or not you believe it was intentional.  No
    matter what you choose to do, you should contact the appropriate
    Carpentry administrator at
    [admin@software-carpentry.org](mailto:admin@software-carpentry.org)
    or [admin@datacarpentry.org](mailto:admin@datacarpentry.org) as
    soon as you can, and describe what happened in the next online
    debriefing session that you're able to attend.

    You also have the right as an instructor to walk out of a workshop
    if you feel that the participants or hosts are not supporting your
    attempts to enforce the Code of Conduct.  Again, please contact us
    as soon as possible if this happens.

A Code of Conduct is one way to create a safe learning space - making sure that 
you are properly motivating (and not de-motivating) your students is another.  In 
our next module, we will talk in more detail about what we can 
do to support motivation in our learners.
