During this period after lunch, we'll be talking about some of the nuts and bolts 
of getting involved in the Carpentries.  First, we'll discuss what actions you'll 
need to take after this training to become a fully certified instructor.  After that, 
we'll address any questions about the Carpentries organizations, running workshops, and 
getting involved in the community in other ways.  

## Application form

Make sure that you have filled out the Carpentries 
[instructor application form](https://amy.software-carpentry.org/forms/request_training/). 
We can not track your progress and make you an official instructor without it. If you have already
filled out this form, you do not need to submit another application.

## Instructor Checkout

As you read in your homework last night, the final three steps in qualifying as an instructor are to:

1.  Make a contribution to a lesson's content, exercises, or instructor notes by doing **one** of the following:
    1.  Submit a change (i.e. pull request) to fix an existing issue.
    2.  Proof-read a lesson and add a new issue describing something to be improved.
    3.  Provide substantive feedback on an existing issue or pull request.
2.  Take part in a [discussion session][discussion] with experienced instructors.
3.  Prepare to teach a full Carpentries lesson (i.e. the content of one lesson repository). Then perform a 5-minute [live coding demo][demo] for that lesson starting at a point chosen by the session lead.

[This page]({{ page.root }}/checkout/) explains the procedure in detail. 
There's also a [helpful checklist](http://www.datacarpentry.org/checkout/) 
if you'd prefer a brief summary.

> ## Checking Out Review with Questions and Answers
> 
> In small groups, read and discuss one of the three checkout procedures listed above and described in detail at [This page]({{ page.root }}/checkout/). Make notes in the etherpad and when you're done, report back to the full group about the requirements for that stage of the process. What questions do you still have about the checkout process? 
> 
> This exercise should take about 5 minutes.

> ## Schedule a Discussion or Demo
> 
> Visit the [discussion Etherpad][discussion] to sign up for a session. 
> If the session you would like to attend is full, contact the discussion
> host and co-host to ask if you can attend. 
>
> If you'd prefer to do your teaching demonstration before your discussion, 
> visit the [demo Etherpad][demo] and sign up there. 
>
> This exercise should take 5 minutes.

### Lesson Contribution

The lesson materials for Software and Data Carpentry
are hosted on GitHub:

*   [Data Carpentry on GitHub]({{ site.dc_github }})
*   [Software Carpentry on GitHub]({{ site.swc_github }})

and are developed collaboratively.  Each lesson is in a separate
repository, and consists of narrative lesson material and an
associated directory containing the data or scripts needed in the
lesson.  This source material is also then served as a website, using
GitHub's "gh-pages" feature.

Lesson contribution is managed within the repository using "issues"
and "pull requests".  New problems or suggestions can be introduced
as issues, discussed by the community, and addressed via a pull
request, which serves as a "request" to make changes, and can also
be discussed before changes are merged.  

> ## Check Out the Discussion (Optional)
>
> As an instructor, your voice is important! We want you to be actively involved
> in discussions about the lesson materials (and other aspects of the Carpentry community).
> Go to the GitHub page for the lesson you worked with over the past two days and click on the
> "Issues" tab. Read through some of the discussions and, if you have anything to add, please add it
> to the conversation! If you wish to make a pull request, be sure to examine the contribution guidelines for 
> the repository you are working in. If you do make a significant contribution to the discussion, send a link to
> the issue to [checkout@carpentries.org](mailto: checkout@carpentries.org). Congratulations! You've
> just completed one of the three remaining steps in becoming a Carpentry instructor.
>
> Leave about 5-10 minutes for this exercise.

> ## Ongoing support
> 
> Discussion sessions aren't only for instructors-in-training working towards their certification. 
> Instructors are highly encouraged to participate in discussions before and after each of their workshops, 
> so that they can continue to learn from each other and advance their teaching skills. For even more support, consider
> participating in our Carpentries [Mentoring program][mentoring]!
