In order for learners to step out into new and familiar terrain, they will
need encouragement.  This section discusses typical ways that
learners are motivated (and can be demotivated!) and provides practice opportunities
for you to become confident in motivating your learners.

## Creating A Positive Learning Environment

Creating a positive learning environment is an important first step to setting the stage
for learner success. As instructors, it is crucial to establish the workshop setting
as a safe space for learning. Establishing a safe space for learning is a combination 
of many factors:

+ *Presenting the instructor as a learner*. Admitting that you don't know everything is part of showing that it is acceptable to make mistakes, and encouraging a growth mindset in learners (we'll talk much more about growth mindset in [a later lesson]({{ page.root }}/09-mindset/)). Using live coding in teaching concepts is very useful for this reason. It is common to make errors while live coding. When done well, these errors can be very instructive for novice learners.
+ *Establishing norms for interaction*. This can be done by having, discussing, and enforcing a Code of Conduct or by having rules of interaction such as ensuring turn taking in discussions, possibly by passing around a talking stick, or by encouraging quieter people to contribute.
+ *Encouraging learners to learn from each other*. Acknowledge that some of the material can be difficult and that they will learn more working together. Asking more advanced learners to help beginner learners is a good way to maximize learning for both.
+ *Acknowledging when learners are confused.* Understanding why learners are confused provides useful feedback for instructors. We use formative assessments to pinpoint leaners' misunderstandings. Acknowledging that their misunderstandings are valid is also key to encouraging a growth mindset.

## Teach Most Useful First

People learn best when they care about a topic and believe they can master it.
This presents us with a problem
because most scientists don't want to program:
they want to do science.
In addition,
their early experiences with computers are often demoralizing,
and believing that something will be hard to learn is a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Imagine a grid whose axes are labelled "mean time to master" and "usefulness once mastered".
Everything that's quick to master, and immediately useful should be taught first;
things in the opposite corner
that are hard to learn and have little near-term application
don't belong in our workshops.

> ## Actual Time
>
> Any useful estimate of how long something takes to master must take into account
> how frequent failures are
> and how much time is lost to them.
> For example,
> editing a text file seems like a simple task,
> but most graphical editors save things to the user's desktop or home directory.
> If people need to run shell commands on the files they've edited,
> a substantial fraction won't be able to navigate to the right directory without help.
> If this seems like a small problem to you,
> please revisit the discussion of [expert blind spot]({{ page.root }}/03-expertise.md#limitations-of-expertise).
{: .callout}

We have therefore adopted a "teach most immediately useful first" approach.
We try to have learners do something that *they* think is useful in their daily work
within 15 minutes of starting each lesson.
This not only motivates them,
it also helps build their confidence in us,
so that if it takes longer to get to something they find useful in a later topic,
they'll persist with the lesson.

> ## Authentic Tasks: Think, Pair, Share
>
> **Think** about some task you did this week that uses one or more of the skills we teach,
> (e.g. wrote a function, bulk downloaded data, built a plot in R, forked a repo)
> and explain how you would use it (or a simplified version of it) as an exercise or example in class.
> **Pair** up with your neighbor and decide where this exercise fits on a graph of "short/long time to master" and "low/high usefulness".
> In the class Etherpad, **share** the task and where it fits on the graph.
> As a group, we will discuss how these relate back to our "teach most immediately useful first" approach.
>
> This exercise and discussion should take about 10 minutes.

## Other Motivational Strategies  

In addition to teaching things that will make our learners' lives easier and focusing
on authentic tasks, there are a number of other strategies we can use to motivate
learners.

> ## Strategies for Motivating Learners
>
> *[How Learning Works][amazon-hlw]* by Susan Ambrose, et al, 
> contains this list of evidence-based methods to motivate learners.
>
> In groups of two or three, pick three of these points and briefly describe
> in the Etherpad how can we apply these strategies in our workshops.
>
> * Strategies to Establish Value
>     1. Connect the material to students' interests.
>     2. Provide authentic, real-world tasks.
>     3. Show relevance to students' current academic lives.
>     4. Demonstrate the relevance of higher-level skills to students' future professional lives.
>     5. Identify and reward what you value.
>     6. Show your own passion and enthusiasm for the discipline.
> * Strategies to Build Positive Expectations
> 	1. Ensure alignment of objectives, assessments, and instructional strategies.
> 	2. Identify an appropriate level of challenge.
> 	3. Create assignments that provide an appropriate level of challenge.
> 	4. Provide early success opportunities.
> 	5. Articulate your expectations.
> 	6. Provide rubrics.
> 	7. Provide targeted feedback.
> 	8. Be fair.
> 	9. Educate students about the ways we explain success and failure.
> 	10. Describe effective study strategies.
> * Strategies for Self-Efficacy
> 	1. Provide students with options and the ability to make choices.
> 	2. Give students an opportunity to reflect.
> 
> This exercise and discussion should take about 5 minutes.
{: .challenge}

> ## Provide an Example
>
> Insert a personal story here about how you establish value in the classroom.
>
> Or, insert an example story about establishing value, which goes like this:
>
> "In the [SWC Unix "Finding Things" episode](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/07-find/),
> a haiku is used to to teach grep.
> This is a great didactic tool, but it can be hard for learners to see how it applies to research.
> After the didactic example, I connect my bioinformatics users with domain-specific examples by showing
> [a list of one-line unix commands](https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/bioiteam/Scott's+list+of+linux+one-liners)
> consisting of  `grep`, `sort`, `head`, and `uniq` to explore biological sequence data.
> This emphasizes how they can apply what they learned with haikus to real bioinformatics research problems."

## How Not to Demotivate Your Learners

One of our biggest challenges as instructors when teaching a workshop is to not demotivate participants through our words or actions. None of us goes into 
a workshop with the intention of creating a hostile environment or making the learners
hate the tools we're teaching, but we can all accidentally do just that if we don't 
pay attention to what we say and how we interact with our learners. We'll discuss some
common demotivators and help you develop strategies for avoiding them.

### Things You Shouldn't Do in a Workshop

*   Tell learners they are rubbish because they use Excel and/or Word,
    don't modularize their code, etc.
*   Say negative things about Windows and praise Linux, e.g., say that
    the former is for amateurs.
*   Criticize GUI applications (and by implication their users) and
    describe command-line tools as the One True Way.
*   Talk contemptuously or with scorn about any tool. Regardless of 
    its shortcomings, many of your learners may be using that tool.
    Convincing someone to change their practices is much harder when 
    they think you disdain them.
*   Dive into complex or detailed technical discussion with the one or
    two people in the audience who clearly don't actually need to be
    there.
*   Pretend to know more than you do.  People will actually trust you
    more if you are frank about the limitations of your knowledge, and
    will be more likely to ask questions and seek help.
*   Use the J word ("just") or other demotivating words we talked about in a 
    [previous lesson]({{ page.root }}/03-expertise/). These signal to the learner that
    the instructor thinks their problem is trivial
    and by extension that they therefore must be stupid
    for not being able to figure it out.
*  Feign surprise. Saying things like "I can't believe you don't know X"
    or "You've never heard of Y?" signals to the learner that they do not have
    some required pre-knowledge of the material you are teaching, that they don't belong at the workshop,
    and it may prevent them from asking questions in
    the future. (For more on this see the Recurse Center's [Social Rules][recurse-social-rules]).

It can be difficult to avoid these demotivators entirely. Some people are so used to 
making fun of Windows-users with their friends, or talking about how terrible Excel is 
that they initially fail to realize they're doing it while teaching. Teaching yourself
to avoid these types of comments takes practice, but is well worth the effort. No one
likes to be made fun of, and talking badly about people who use GUIs, or who aren't 
writing their thesis in LaTeX is unlikely to make them excited about learning your 
favorite scripting language. 

> ## Brainstorming Demotivational Experiences
>
> *Think* back to a time when you were demotivated as a student (or when you demotivated a student).
> *Pair* up with your neighbor and discuss what could have been done differently in the situation to make it not demotivating.
> *Share* your story in the Etherpad.  
>
> This exercise should take about 5 minutes.

## Psychological Demotivators

As instructors, we can learn to avoid talking disparagingly about our learners' choice
of text editors and levels of technical knowledge. This helps a lot in avoid 
demotivating learners. There are other factors, however, that contribute to demotivation, 
some of which are either systemic, or built into our psychological makeup as human beings. 
We can still have a positive impact in fighting these demotivators by thinking carefully about 
the language that we use and how we interact with our learners.

### Stereotype Threat
One major psychological demotivator is *stereotype threat*. Reminding people of negative stereotypes,
even in subtle ways, can make them anxious about the risk of confirming those stereotypes, in turn reducing
their performance. This is called *[stereotype threat][wikipedia-stereotype-threat]*,
and the clearest examples in computing are gender-related. Depending on whose numbers you trust,
only 12-18% of programmers are women, and those figures have actually been getting worse over the last 20 years.
There are many reasons for this (see Margolis and Fisher's *[Unlocking the Clubhouse][amazon-clubhouse]*
and Margolis's *[Stuck in the Shallow End][amazon-shallow-end]*). Steele's *[Whistling Vivaldi][amazon-whistling-vivaldi]*
summarizes what we know about stereotype threat in general and presents some strategies for mitigating it in 
the classroom.

While there's lots of evidence that unwelcoming climates demotivate members of under-represented groups,
it's not clear that stereotype threat is the underlying mechanism. Part of the problem is that
[the term has been used in many ways][shapiro-neuberg-stereotype-threat].
Another is that there are [questions about the replicability of key studies][jussim-stereotype-threat].
What *is* clear is that we need to avoid thinking in terms of a deficit model
(i.e., we need to change the members of under-represented groups because they have some deficit, 
such as lack of prior experience) and instead use a systems approach 
(i.e., we need to change the system because it produces these disparities).

> ## Never Learn Alone

> One way to support at-risk learners of all kinds is to ask people to sign up for workshops in small teams
> rather than as individuals when possible.
> If an entire lab group comes,
> or if attendees are drawn from the same (or closely-related) disciplines,
> everyone in the room will know in advance
> that they will be with at least a few people they trust,
> which increases the chances of them actually coming.
> Furthermore, 
> if people attend a workshop with their labmates, it's more likely they will
> work together to implement what they've learned after the workshop has ended.

> knowing that we have rules
> tells people a great deal about our values
> and about what kind of learning experience they can expect.
{: .callout}

### Impostor Syndrome

Another major psychological demotivator is *[impostor syndrome][wikipedia-impostor-syndrome]*.
Imposter syndrome is the belief that one is not good enough for a job or position,
and that one's achievements are due to luck rather than talent or skill.
This is also accompanied by the fear of being "found out".

Academic work is frequently undertaken alone or in small groups but the results are shared and 
criticized publicly. In addition,
we rarely see the struggles of others, only their finished work, which can feed the belief that everyone 
else finds it easy. Women and minority groups, who already feel additional pressure to prove themselves in
some settings, [may be particularly affected][high-achieving-women].

Two ways of dealing with your own impostor syndrome are:

1.  Ask for feedback from someone you respect and trust.
    Ask them for their honest thoughts on your strengths and achievements,
    and commit to believing them.
2.  Look for role models.
    Who do you know who presents as confident and capable?
    Think about how they conduct themselves.
    What lessons can you learn from them?
    What habits can you borrow?
    (Remember, they quite possibly also feel as if they are making it up as they go.)

As an instructor,
you can help people with their impostor syndrome by
sharing stories of mistakes that you have made or things you struggled to learn.
This reassures the class that it's OK to find topics difficult.
Being open with the group makes it easier to build trust and make students confident to ask questions.
(Live coding is great for this:
typos let the class see you're not superhuman.)

You can also emphasize that you want questions:
you are not succeeding as a teacher if no one can follow your class,
so you're asking students to help you learn and improve.
Remember,
it's much more important to *be* smart than to *look* smart.

The Ada Initiative has
[some excellent resources][ada-initiative-resources]
for teaching about and dealing with imposter syndrome.

> ## Overcoming Imposter Syndrome
> 
> Think of a time when learning something was difficult for you, or
> you made a mistake that seemed silly or embarassing. Is that task still hard for you?
> In the Etherpad, describe how you might you use this as a motivational story to help your learners 
> overcome their own imposter syndrome. 
> 
> This exercise should take about 5 minutes.

### Accessibility Issues

Not providing equal access to lessons and exercises
is about as demotivating as it gets.
If you look at [our old lesson on Python][swc-python-v4],
for example,
you'll find that the text beside the slides includes all of the narration---but
none of the Python source code.
Someone using a [screen reader][wikipedia-screen-reader]
would therefore be able to hear what was being said about the program,
but wouldn't know what the program actually was.

While it may not be possible to accommodate everyone's needs,
it *is* possible to get a good working structure in place
without any knowledge of what specific disabilities people might have.
Having at least some accommodations prepared also makes it clear that
hosts and instructors care enough to have thought about problems in advance,
and that any additional concerns are likely to be addressed.

> ## It Helps Everyone
>
> [Curb cuts][wikipedia-curb-cuts]
> (the small sloped ramps joining a sidewalk to the street)
> were originally created to make it easier for wheelchair users to move around,
> but proved to be equally helpful to people with strollers and grocery carts.
> Similarly,
> steps taken to make lessons more accessible to people with various disabilities
> also help everyone else.
> Proper captioning of images,
> for example,
> benefits people with no or limited vision by giving screen readers something to say:
> but it also makes the images more findable
> by exposing their content to search engines.
{: .callout}

The first step is to know what you need to do. There are a number of good resources for learning
about accessibility. 

> ## One Thing
> 
> The UK Home Office has put together a set of posters of dos and don'ts for making
> visual and web-based materials more accessible for different populations. Take a look at one of 
> [these posters](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/posters/tree/master/accessibility/posters_en-UK) and 
> put one thing you've learned in the Etherpad. 
> 
> Note: There are [translations](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/posters/tree/master/accessibility)
> available in a number of languages, including Dutch, French, Spanish, Swedish, Portugese, German, and
> Chinese.
> 
> This exercise should take about 5 minutes.
{: .challenge}

The [W3C Accessibility Initiative's checklist for presentations][w3c-accessible]
is a good starting point focused primarily on assisting the visually impaired,
while Liz Henry's blog post about
[accessibility at conferences][conference-accessibility]
has a good checklist for people with mobility issues,
and [this interview][deaf-accessibility]
with Chad Taylor is a good introduction to issues faced by those with no or limited hearing.

The second is to know how well you're doing.
For example,
sites like [WebAIM][webaim] allow you to check
how accessible your online materials are to users with no or limited vision.

The third,
and most important,
is to *involve people with disabilities in decision-making*.
Our mailing lists are a good place to ask for advice,
and updates to [our accessibility checklist]({{ site.swc_site }}/checklists/accessibility/)
are always welcome.

### Inclusivity

*Inclusivity* is a policy of including people who might otherwise be excluded or marginalized.
In computing, it means making a positive effort to be more welcoming to women,
people of color, people with various sexual orientations,
the elderly, people with physical disabilities, the formerly incarcerated,
the economically disadvantaged, and everyone else who doesn't fit Silicon Valley's white/Asian male demographic.
Lee's paper
"[What can I do today to create a more inclusive community in CS?]({{ page.root }}/files/papers/lee-create-inclusive-community-2015.pdf)"
is a brief, practical guide with references to the research literature.
These help learners who belong to one or more marginalized or excluded groups,
but help motivate everyone else as well. 

Many of these can be applied to our workshops,
such as:

*   asking learners to email you before the workshop
    to explain how they believe the training could help them achieve their goals;
*   reviewing notes to make sure they are free from gendered pronouns,
    that they include culturally diverse names,
    etc.;
*   emphasizing that what matters is the rate at which they are learning,
    not the level of knowledge they had when they started;
*   encouraging pair programming; and
*   actively mitigating behavior that some learners may find intimidating,
    e.g.,
    use of jargon or "questions" that are actually asked to display knowledge.
