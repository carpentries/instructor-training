One of the most important things that you can do as an instructor is to
set the workshop environment from the beginning.  One way to do this 
is by having a well-planned introduction.  This episode discusses the 
value of setting the environment from the beginning and some of the 
components that go into an effective introduction.  

## Setting the Workshop Environment

> ## Your Academic Past
> 
> Think back to courses or workshops you really liked or didn't like.
> How did those courses start? Were you confident in the
instructors abilities? Did you feel like they were
enthusiastic about the course and invested in you? Was it clear
what you were going to be learning? Were you excited about the material? Or did you leave that first day thinking
the instructor was uninterested, that you weren't the learners they wanted to
be teaching or you had no idea what the course was supposed to be about?
{: .discussion}

Your impression on the first day of a course probably matched that of the rest of
the course. Introductions set the tone for the workshop and the path for learning.

Introductions are particularly important when we have just two days. Also, in Carpentry workshops
we're teaching not only a set of skills, but also trying to give learners the confidence to become self-directed learners. Learners should leave feeling excited and empowered. It's up to you as an instructor to empower
your learners, so it's important
to set a positive and welcoming environment for the workshop. 

Having a planned introduction, also helps you be less nervous. Having a planned introduction
helps get you started. Even in the face of
early technical issues  (which is common at the start of a workshop), you can have a chance to reset with something
you're comfortable and ready for.

## Goals For the Introduction

After the introduction learners should:

- believe in your competence to teach the workshop
- be able to predict the type of instruction
- know what will be taught
- know what will be required of them

The instructor should:

- have an understanding of who is taking the workshop and what their expectations are

## Components of the Introduction

To meet these objectives an introduction should:

1.  Set positive first impressions
1.  Introduce yourself effectively
1.  Clarify learning objectives and expectations
1.  Help learners learn about each other
1.  Set the tone for the workshop
1.  Collect baseline data on learners' knowledge and motivation
1.  Whet learners' appetite for workshop content
1.  Inform learners of workshop requirements

### 1. Set Positive First Impressions

First impressions can be long-lasting. Before you even start teaching, your learners
will have already made some decisions about you, so it is important to
understand what those impressions are based on and how to manage them.

**Your attire.** Research shows that clothing affects the
judgments people make, including credibility,
likability, dominance, kindness, and empathy (Raiscot, 1986; Morris et
al., 1996). More formal attire communicates expertise and confidence.
Less formal attire communicates approachability. Usually, it is easier
to relax from a more formal impression into a more relaxed one than the
other way around. These considerations are likely to be particularly
relevant for young instructors who are concerned about establishing
themselves as authoritative.

**The physical environment**. Learners can make decisions about what
kind of course yours will be by the way the chairs are arranged. Rows
signify a more formal environment, while circles or U-shapes imply a
more informal atmosphere, with higher expectations of learner
participation. 

**Your use of the few minutes before class.** Greeting the learners as
they enter the classroom communicates approachability. Frantically
arriving right on time or late communicates disorganization.

### 2. Introduce Yourself Effectively

Your introduction should be succinct, but make sure to cover certain
key areas. These questions should help you decide what to say:

**What characteristics do you want to convey about yourself?** You probably want the learners to get a sense of your
qualifications, how formal/informal you want
to be, and how available you will be to the learners. You want to
demonstrate that you're qualified, but that you share the same
challenges as the learners, so you remain accessible.

**What will you need to say to convey those characteristics?**
Consider talking about your research and computational interests as
they relate to the workshop, in order to establish yourself as an
authority, and to make to workshop more relevant.

**Why are you teaching a Software or Data Carpentry workshop?**
Why are you an instructor? What's motivating you to be there today? One
reason might be that you took a workshop and saw how valuable these
skills were in your own work and wanted to share this information with
others. Convey your enthusiasm for being there.

**What should you be careful not to say?** Learners do not need to
know everything about you. In particular, it is not helpful to say
you've never taught the course before, or that it is your least
favorite course to teach, or to disclose any irrelevant personal
information that can undermine you in the eyes of your learners.

> Write out your answers to the questions above.  What do you 
> want to say about yourself before you start a workshop?  
> 
> This exercise should take 5 minutes.

### 3. Clarify Learning Objectives and Your Expectations

This is probably the most important step. Clearly laying out
expectations orients learners towards what you expect from them,
and helps them use their time productively.

**Describe the prerequisites** so learners will know what information
you are assuming they already know. For Data Carpentry no prior
computational experience is required. Expectations vary for Software
Carpentry workshops. Convey what your expectations are.

**Highlight main aspects of the schedule.**

**Communicate the workshop structure** so the learners will
understand the decisions that have made in designing the workshop. 
Make sure to highlight
the learning objectives and the hands-on instructional strategies we use and
the workshop policies.

**Explain your expectations** for learner behavior including expectations
around: 

- [Code of Conduct](datacarpentry.org/code-of-conduct/)
- ways to ask for help
- ways to give instructors feedback

**Communicate your commitment** to the learners' learning experience.

**Share some advice for success** in your course. Let learners
know you are confident in their success as long as they put in
the required effort.

### 4. Help Learners Learn About Each Other

The classroom is a social environment, so it is helpful to start the
social dynamics in a productive way.

Icebreakers raise the energy levels and get learners comfortable so
that they will be ready to work in groups or dialogue with each other.  

> ## Example Icebreaker
> Here is one example of an icebreaker you can use:  
> Have everyone turn to a partner and introduce themselves with their
> name, one word about their research 'microbes', 'dogs', 'vectors',
> 'stars' and a thing they're proud of that they made. 
{: .callout}

Other examples of Icebreakers can be found [on this page][icebreakers].  

### 5. Set the Tone for the Workshop

The way you engage learners at the beginning sends powerful messages
about the level of involvement and interaction you expect from them.

Since these workshops are hands-on don't spend a lot of the time at
the beginning lecturing. Get to introductions and interactions
right away. You don't want learners to think they just have to listen
in the course.

Also establish a culture of feedback. Let learners know you are
interested in how they experience the course and in any suggestions
they have. Let them know they should feel free to give you constructive 
feedback, even
anonymously. They can do this in particular with minute cards. You
might not adopt every suggestion they have but you will listen and
consider them. This starts to create a partnership in learning.

### 6. Collect Baseline Data on Learners' Knowledge and Motivation

You will already have information on their skill level from the
pre-assessment survey. 
Before starting your workshop, decide what to do about different/inadequate prior knowledge.  If this
is a workshop where a certain knowledge is required (such as an
advertised advanced workshop), decide in advance how you will handle a
range of skill sets.  You might tell them they cannot take the
workshop, or that they must work through certain sections on their
own.

### 7. Whet Learners' Appetites for Workshop Content

They're already at the workshop, so it might seem unnecessary to
motivate them to be there, but it is a great chance to stimulate
interest about the workshop and to activate relevant prior knowledge
learners have about the material.

### 8. Inform Learners of Logistics

Let them know about any logistics for the days - lunch times, breaks,
accessibility, etc.

> ## Practice Your Introduction 
>
> Imagine you have completed instructor training and you are about to teach a full lesson around the material you have been practicing teaching today. 
> 1. Rehearse your introduction in your mind. (3 minutes)
> 2. Return to your groups of 2 or 3 and each give your 90 second introduction. (5 min)
> 3. Discuss what you liked about each other's introductions. (6 min: optional, if there is time.)
>
> This exercise will take 8 minutes or 14 minutes depending on whether time is included for feedback or not.
