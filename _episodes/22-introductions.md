One of the most important things that you can do as an instructor is 
set the workshop environment from the beginning.  One way to do this 
is by having a well-planned introduction.  This episode discusses the 
value of setting the environment from the beginning and some of the 
components that go into an effective introduction.  

## Setting the Workshop Environment

> ## Your Academic Past
> 
> Think back to courses or workshops you really liked or didn't like.
> How did those courses start on the first day? Were you confident in the
instructors ability to teach the course? Did you feel like the instructor was
enthusiastic about the course and invested in the students outcomes? Was it clear
what you were going to be learning? Were you excited to get the chance
to be learning about those things? Or did you leave that first day thinking
the instructor was uninterested, that you weren't the students they wanted to
be teaching or you had no idea what the course was supposed to be about?
{: .discussion}

Your impression on the first day of a course probably matched that of the rest of
the course. We don't usually think explicitly about introductions,
but they set the tone for the workshop and the path for learner outcomes.

This is particularly important when we have just two days, and no time to
correct over a semester long course. Also, in Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry
we're teaching not only a set of skills, but at least as importantly
we're trying to give learners the confidence to use these tools and learn more
on their own. Students should leave feeling excited and empowered, rather
than overwhelmed or not capable. It's up to you as an instructor to empower
your students - to make them feel like they can learn these new things and
go on to use it in their work and even learn more. It is therefore important
to set a positive and welcoming environment for the workshop and that starts
with the introduction. Also it is possible to help overcome stereotype threat
in the introduction.

The other thing that's great about having a planned introduction, is that
it helps you as an instructor be less nervous. Even if you've taught a lot
before each workshop is new and it's a new group. Having a planned introduction
helps get you started and knowing what you'll say. So even in the face of
early technical issues, you can have a chance to reset and get going on something
you're comfortable and ready with.

## Goals For the Introduction

After the introduction students should:

- believe in your competence to teach the workshop
- be able to predict the type of instruction
- know what the learning objectives are (what will be taught)
- know what will be required of them

The instructor should:

- have an understanding of who is taking the workshop and what their expectations are

## Components of the Introduction

To meet these objectives an introduction should:

1.  Orchestrate positive first impressions
1.  Introduce yourself effectively
1.  Clarify learning objectives and expectations
1.  Help students learn about each other
1.  Set the tone for the workshop
1.  Collect baseline data on students' knowledge and motivation
1.  Whet students' appetite for workshop content
1.  Inform students of workshop requirements

### 1. Orchestrate Positive First Impressions

First impressions can be long-lasting, and they are usually based on a
thin slice of behavior. Before you even start teaching, your students
will have already made some decisions about you, so it is important to
understand what those impressions are based on and how to manage them.

**Your attire.** Research shows that clothing affects several kinds of
judgments people make, including but not limited to, credibility,
likability, dominance, kindness, and empathy (Raiscot, 1986; Morris et
al., 1996). More formal attire communicates expertise and confidence,
less formal attire communicates approachability. Usually, it is easier
to relax a more formal impression into a more relaxed one than the
other way around. These considerations are likely to be particularly
relevant for young instructors who are concerned about establishing
themselves as authoritative.

**The physical environment**. Students can make decisions about what
kind of course yours will be by the way the chairs are arranged. Rows
signify a more formal environment, while circles or u-shapes imply a
more informal atmosphere, with more expectations of student
participation. The words on the board also indicate how interesting
the course is likely to be. In addition to the course information,
consider having a thought-provoking question displayed as they arrive.

**Your use of the few minutes before class.** Greeting the students as
they enter the classroom communicates approachability. Frantically
arriving right on time or even late communicates disorganization, and
so on.

### 2. Introduce Yourself Effectively

Your introduction should be succinct, but make sure to cover certain
key areas. These questions should help you decide what to say:

**What characteristics do you want to convey about yourself?** Among
other things, you probably want the students to get a sense of your
qualifications for teaching the course, how formal/informal you want
to be, and how available you will be to the students. You want to
demonstrate that you're qualified, but that you share the same
challenges as the students, so you remain accessible and not too much
of an 'expert' who has entirely different considerations than they do.

**What will you need to say to convey those characteristics?**
Consider talking about your research and computational interests as
they relate to the workshop, in order to establish yourself as an
authority, and to make to workshop more relevant.

**Why are you teaching a Software or Data Carpentry workshop?** Why
are you an instructor? What's motivating you to be there today? One
reason might be that you took a workshop and saw how valuable these
skills were in your own work and wanted to share this information with
others. Convey your enthusiasm for being there.

**What should you be careful not to say?** Students do not need to
know everything about you. In particular, it is not helpful to say
you've never taught the course before, or that it is your least
favorite course to teach, or to disclose any irrelevant personal
information that can undermine you in the eyes of your students.

### 3. Clarify Learning Objectives and Your Expectations

This is probably the most important objective. Clearly laying out
expectations starts to orient students toward the kind of effort,
learning, performance and classroom behaviors you expect from them,
and it helps them use their time productively.

Describe the prerequisites so that students will know what information
the instructors are assuming they know. For Data Carpentry no prior
computational experience is required. Expectations vary for Software
Carpentry workshops, and sometimes there is no particular set of
expectations, but convey if there are.

Highlight main aspects of the schedule.

Communicate the workshop structure to the students so they will
understand the decisions that have made in designing the workshop and
the reasons why they were made. In particular, make sure to highlight
the learning objectives and the hands on instructional strategies that
SWC and DC use, the workshop policies, and the rationale for the
structure and the policies, and the reasons for choosing to use CC-BY
materials.

Explain your expectations for student behavior including expectations
for:

- Code of Conduct
- punctuality
- seeking help when needed
- offering feedback when appropriate - questions during course, minute
  cards at each break using sticky notes for student participation
- communicate your commitment to the students' learning experience.

Share some advice for success in your course (give it a try!) and let
them know you are confident in their success as long as they put in
the required effort.

### 4. Help Students Learn About Each Other

The classroom is a social environment, so it is helpful to start the
social dynamics in a productive way.

Icebreakers raise the energy levels and get students comfortable so
that they will be ready to focus on the material, especially if you
want to foster a collaborative environment where students will have to
work in groups or dialogue with each other.  Icebreakers work even
better when they allow students to get to know each other in the
context of the course material.

Have everyone turn to a partner and introduce themselves with their
name, one word about their research 'microbes', 'dogs', 'vectors',
'stars' and a thing they're proud of that they made. What they made
could be a bookshelf, a curry, a 3D plot, a piece of software, their
bed this morning, just something they did that they're proud of.
Studies have shown that encouraging people to think about their
characteristics, skills, values, or roles that they value or view as
important can help reduce the effects of stereotype threat. (We have
no actual evidence this particular exercise helps, but it is along
these lines)

### 5. Set the Tone for the Workshop

The way you engage students at the beginning sends powerful messages
about the level of involvement and interaction you expect from them.

Since these workshops are hands on don't spend a lot of the time at
the beginning lecturing. Get in to introductions and interactions
right away. You don't want students to think they just have to listen
in the course.

Also establish a culture of feedback. Let students know you are
interested in how they experience the course and in any suggestions
they have. Let them know you will do formal early course evaluations,
but that they should feel free to give you constructive feedback, even
anonymously. They can do this in particular with minute cards. You
might not adopt every suggestion they have but you will listen and
consider them. This starts to create a partnership in learning.

### 6. Collect Baseline Data on Students' Knowledge and Motivation

This objective stems directly from the second overarching goal for the
first day of class.

You will already have information on their skill level from the
pre-assessment survey. You don't want to necessarily take the time to
go around the room asking everyone why they're motivated to be there
(although you might, especially if it's a new version of a course),
but you could ask them to write it on a card and have them hand it in
at the break.

One side of the card could be 'why are you motivated to be here?' and
the other could be 'what do you expect to get out of the workshop?'

Decide what to do about different/inadequate prior knowledge.  If this
is a workshop where a certain knowledge is required (such as an
advertised advanced workshop), decide in advance how you will handle a
range of skill sets.  You might tell them they cannot take the
workshop, or that they must work through certain sections on their
own.

### 7. Whet Students' Appetites for Workshop Content

They're already at the workshop, so it might seem unnecessary to
motivate them to be there, but it is a great chance to stimulate
interest about the workshop and to activate relevant prior knowledge
students have about the material.

### 8. Inform Students of Logistics

Let them know about any logistics for the days - lunch times, breaks,
accessibility, etc.


> ## Practice Your Introduction with Feedback
> 
> In groups of two or three, practice delivering your introduction, as if you 
> were starting off a workshop.  After trading off, offer each other feedback.

>
> 1. Imagine you have completed instructor training and you are about to teach a full lesson around the material you have been practicing teaching today. 
> 2. Rehearsing your introduction in your mind. (3 minutes)
> 3. Return to your groups of 2 or 3 and give 90 second introductions. (5 min)
>
> This exercise will take 8 minutes.
