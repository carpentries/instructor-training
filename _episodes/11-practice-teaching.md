So far, we've focused on how we can be effective instructors in helping our learners
develop computational skills. We've seen that providing opportunities for practice 
and giving useful feedback to learners are essential components in the learning 
process. Learning to teach is no different. Instructors develop teaching skill
over time through practice and improve most when given feedback on their performance
from other instructors who share their pedagogical model. In this section, we'll 
discuss how instructors improve their teaching and give you some opportunities to
practice. 

## Lesson Study: Applying a Growth Mindset to Teaching

Many people assume that teachers are born, not made.
From politicians to researchers and teachers themselves,
most reformers have designed systems to find and promote those who can teach
and eliminate those who can't.
As Elizabeth Green describes in
*[Building a Better Teacher][worldcat-babt]*,
though,
that assumption is wrong,
which is why educational reforms based on it have repeatedly failed.

In the 1980s and 90s, an educational psychologist named James Stigler observed 
teachers in the US and Japan. In the [OECD's annual rankings][oecd-pisa] of countries' educational
achievements, Japanese students routinely test near the top in reading, math and science, while
American students rank at or below average.

Looking at differences in teaching methods, Stigler found that American teachers met at most once
a year to exchange ideas about teaching, compared to the weekly or even daily meetings of Japanese
teachers. During these meetings, teachers in the US described their lessons to each other, but they did
not observe each others' teaching in practice. In contrast, Japanese teachers regularly conducted lesson study: 
observing each other at work, discussing the lesson afterward, and studying curriculum materials with their 
colleagues.

Closely observing work in this way in order to improve it is commonplace in sports and music.
A professional musician, for example,
will dissect half a dozen different recordings of "Body and Soul" or "Smells Like Teen Spirit" before performing it.
They would also expect to get feedback from fellow musicians during practice and after performances.

But this kind of feedback isn't part of teaching culture in English-language school systems:
in the US, Canada, the UK, Australia, and elsewhere,
what happens in the classroom stays in the classroom.
Teachers don't watch each other's lessons on a regular basis,
so they can't borrow each other's good ideas.
The result is that *every teacher has to invent teaching on their own*.
They may get lesson plans and assignments from colleagues,
the school board,
a textbook publisher,
or the Internet,
but each teacher has to figure out on their own how to combine that with
the theory they've learned in their educational programs
to deliver an actual lesson in an actual classroom for actual learners. 
When teachers don't observe each other teaching, the tricks and techniques that each instructor
has painstakingly incorporated into their practice don't have the opportunity to spread, limiting
forward momentum on system-wide improvements to teaching.

> ## Reading It Isn't Enough
> Several research studies (in [2007][fincher-warren], [2012][fincher-stories], and [2015][barker-practice]) have shown
> that teachers don't adopt instructional practices based on reports about the effectiveness of those practices. 
> Social norms, institutional
> culture, and lack of time and support prevent many teachers from moving out of 
> their accustomed teaching habits. Change in teaching doesn't come about through reading about new teaching practices, but by seeing 
> these practices in action, practicing them and getting feedback from other instructors.

The Carpentries pedagogical model supports lesson study by providing many opportunities for our instructors
to learn from each other. In this training workshop, you will have opportunities to practice teaching for one another 
and to give each other feedback, you'll also have the opportunity to practice in front of an experienced instructor 
as part of your instructor training checkout. In addition, Carpentry instructors always teach in pairs (or more), 
giving you the opportunity to learn by observing and to get feedback from your fellow instructors.

> ## Giving Feedback
>
> We'll start by observing some examples of Carpentry workshop teaching and providing some feedback.
> 
> Watch this [example teaching video][bad-teaching-video] as a group
> and then give feedback on it. Put your feedback in the Etherpad.
> Organize your feedback along two axes:
> positive vs. negative
> and content (what was said) vs. presentation (how it was said).
> This exercise should take about 10 minutes.  
{: .challenge}

Now that you've had some practice observing teaching and giving feedback, let's practice with each other.

> ## Feedback on Yourself
>
> **Trainings where trainees are co-located:** 
> 1.  Split into groups of three.
> 2.  Individually, spend 5 minutes preparing to teach a 90-second segment of 
>     the Carpentry lesson episode you chose before the start of the training course.
> 3.  Get together with your group and have each person teach their segment to the group,
>     while one person records this (video and audio)
>     using a cell phone or some other handheld device.
>     Use a whiteboard or other visual aids if available, but do not use live coding. 
>     We'll be practicing with live coding later.
>     Keep a strict time limit of 90 seconds per person. 
> 3.  After the first person finishes,
>     rotate roles
>     (they become the videographer,
>     the audience becomes the instructor,
>     the person who was recording becomes the audience)
>     and then rotate roles again.
> 4.  After everyone in the group of three has finished teaching,
>     watch the videos as a group.
>     Everyone gives feedback on all three videos,
>     i.e., people give feedback on themselves as well as on others.
> 5.  After everyone has given feedback on all of the videos,
>     return to the main group and put everyone's feedback about you into the Etherpad.
>
> **Distributed trainings:** 
> Your Trainer will split the group into virtual break-out rooms. Follow the instructions above
> but do not record each other. Instead, give each person feedback immediately after they finish their 
> turn teaching. 
> 
> This exercise should take about 25 minutes.

## Feedback Is Hard

Sometimes it can be hard to receive feedback, especially negative feedback.

![Feedback Feelings](../fig/deathbulge-jerk.jpg "Comic from http://www.deathbulge.com/comics/155")

Feedback is most effective when the people involved
share ground rules and expectations. In Carpentries teaching, we use the 2x2 
paradigm for feedback. Each person giving feedback is expected to provide at least one
piece of negative and one piece of positive feedback each for content and delivery. This
helps overcome two common tendencies when giving feedback on teaching: to focus on the content 
(even though delivery is at least as important) and to either provide only negative or 
only positive feedback. 

Here is a list of different
ways that you, as the instructor, can set the stage for receiving feedback
in a way that helps you improve:

*   Initiate feedback.  It's better to ask for feedback than to receive it unwillingly.

*   Choose your own questions and ask for specific feedback.  For example:
    *   "What is one thing I could have done as an instructor to make this
        lesson more effective?"
    *   "If you could pick one thing from the lesson to go over again, what
	would it be?"

Specific feedback like this is more useful than a generic "That was great!" or "That
was terrible!"  Also, writing your own feedback questions allows you to frame
feedback in a way that is helpful to you - the questions above
reveal what didn't work in your teaching, but
read as professional suggestions rather than personal judgments.

* Communicate expectations. If your teaching feedback is taking the form of an
  observation (and you're comfortable enough with the observer), tell
  that person how they can best communicate their feedback to you.

* Balance positive and negative feedback.
    * Ask for or give "compliment sandwiches" (one positive, one negative, one positive)
    * Ask for both types of feedback

* Use a feedback translator.  Have a fellow
  instructor (or other trusted person in the room) read over all the feedback and give
  an executive summary.   It can be easier to hear "It sounds like most people
  are following, so you could speed up" than to read several notes all saying, "this is
  too slow" or "this is boring".

This is part of the reason for Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry's rule,
"Never teach alone."
Having another instructor in the classroom saves your voice
(it's hard to talk for two days straight),
but more importantly,
it's a chance for instructors to learn from one another and be a supportive voice
in the room.
We discuss this in more detail in the next section.

Finally, be kind to yourself.
Mental habits matter: if you're a self-critical person,
it's OK to remind yourself that:

*   It's not personal.
*   Look at the positives along with the negatives.

![Giving Good Feedback](../fig/feedback-artwork.jpg "Comic from http://www.lunarbaboon.com/comics/feedback.html")

Giving good feedback is at least as important as knowing how to receive and process feedback. When
giving feedback, stay positive, be specific and give your feedback recipient a clear next step to follow that
will help them improve. Remember that giving and receiving feedback is a skill that requires practice, so don't 
be frustrated if your feedback is rejected but try to think about why the recipient might not have been comfortable
with the feedback you gave.  

> ## Feedback on Feedback
>
> Watch either this [scipy tutorial][scipy-video-1] (8:40)
> or this [other tutorial][scipy-video-2] (11:42).
> For each, give feedback following the 2x2 
> model. Put your feedback in the Etherpad.
>
> This exercise and discussion should take about 15 minutes.  
{: .challenge}

> ## Using Feedback
> 
> Look back at the feedback you received on your teaching in an earlier exercise. 
> How do you feel about this feedback? Is it fair and reasonable? Do you agree with it? 
> 
> Identify at least one specific change you will make to your teaching based on this feedback.
> Describe your change in the Etherpad.
> 
> This exercise should take about 5 minutes.
{: .challenge}

Hopefully you were able to identify at least one helpful comment in the feedback you received and are able to 
use it to start (or continue) the process of improving your teaching. Remember, teaching is a skill that is learned.
If you notice yourself feeling hurt or threatened by the feedback you got, or rejecting it as unfair or wrong, you 
may have a fixed mindset about teaching. By strengthening your growth mindset with respect to teaching, you can
transform getting feedback from an unpleasant experience to a richly rewarding one. You'll have more opportunities to 
practice teaching and to get and give feedback tomorrow.

## Teaching Together

*Co-teaching* describes any situation in which two teachers work
together in the same classroom.  Friend and Cook's
*[Interactions][worldcat-interactions]* describes several ways to do
this:

- **Team teaching:** Both teachers deliver a single stream of content
  in tandem, taking turns the way that musicians taking solos would.

- **Teach and assist:** Teacher A teaches while Teacher B moves around
  the classroom to help struggling students.

- **Alternative teaching:** Teacher A provides a small set of students
  with more intensive or specialized instruction while Teacher B
  delivers a general lesson to the main group.

- **Teach and observe:** Teacher A teaches while Teacher B observes
  the students, collecting data on their understanding to help plan
  future lessons.

- **Parallel teaching:** The class is divided into two equal groups
  and the teachers present the same material simultaneously to each.

- **Station teaching:** The students are divided into several small
  groups that rotate from one station or activity to the next while
  both teachers supervise where needed.

All of these models are better than teaching alone because they create
opportunities for lateral knowledge transfer; we use team teaching,
teach and assist, and alternative teaching most often in programming
workshops.  Team teaching is particularly beneficial in day-long
workshops: not only does it give each teacher's voice a chance to
rest, it reduces the risk that they will be so tired by the end of the
day that they will start snapping at their students or fumbling at
their keyboard.

> Many people who aren't comfortable teaching are still willing and
> able to provide in-class technical support.  They can help learners
> with setup and installation, answer technical questions during
> exercises, monitor the room to spot people who may need help, or
> keep an eye on the shared notes and either answer questions there or
> remind the instructor to do so during breaks.
>
> Helpers are sometimes people training to become teachers (i.e.,
> they're Teacher B in the teach and assist model), but they can also
> be members of the host institution's technical support staff,
> alumni, or advanced learners who already know the material well.
> Using the latter as helpers is doubly effective: not only are they
> more likely to understand the problems their peers are having, it
> also stops them from getting bored.
>
> The [helper checklist][helpers] describes what helpers can do to
> help instructors in more detail.

If you and a partner are co-teaching, try to follow these rules:

- Take 2-3 minutes before the start of each class to confirm who's
  teaching what with your partner.  (If you have time to do some
  advance preparation, try drawing a concept map together.)

- Use that time to work out a couple of hand signals as well.  "You're
  going too fast", "speak up", "that learner needs help", and, "It's
  time for a bathroom break" are all useful.

- Each person should teach for at least 10-15 minutes at a stretch,
  since students may be distracted by more frequent interleaving.

- The person who isn't teaching shouldn't interrupt, offer
  corrections, elaborations, or amusing personal anecdotes, or do
  anything else to distract from what the person teaching at the time
  is doing or saying.  The one exception is that it's sometimes
  helpful to ask leading questions, particularly if the learners seem
  unsure of themselves.

- Each person should take a couple of minutes before they start
  teaching to see what their partner is going to teach after they're
  done, and then *not* present any of that material.

- The person who isn't teaching should stay engaged with the class,
  not catch up on their email.  Monitor the shared notes, keep an eye
  on the students to see who's struggling, jot down some feedback to
  give your teaching partner at the next break - anything that
  contributes to the lesson is better than anything that doesn't.

Most importantly, take a few minutes when the class is over to either
congratulate or commiserate with each other.  In teaching as in life,
shared misery is lessened and shared joy increased; in that moment,
no-one will understand how pleased you are at helping someone
understand how loops work, or how disappointed you are that you just
couldn't get software to install on that one learner's laptop, than
the person you just taught with.


## Optional Exercises

> ## Skill Acquisition: What level are your teaching skills?
> 
> As with computational skills, people have a tendency to think of teaching as something you are "just good at" or not. However, teaching is a skill, and expertise develops with attentive practice. 
> Examine the descriptions of "novice," "competent practitioner," and "expert." Where do you think you fall with regard to teaching? What have you learned about teaching? What are you aware of that you still need to learn?
> Discuss with a partner and then write some thoughts in the Etherpad.
