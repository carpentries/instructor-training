Just as in our technical workshops, we collect feedback at the end of Instructor Training. 
This will help your Trainers continue to develop *their* skills and to participate in continually improving our curriculum. The Carpentries Surveys also 
provide vital information to The Carpentries Core Team and help us to report to our funders.

> ## One Up, One Down
>
> Provide one up, one down feedback on the entire Instructor Training course. Remember:  
> * Say only one thing, and try not to duplicate. This gets harder for those who come later!
> * Trainers should try not to respond, only record responses (e.g. in the Etherpad). This is also hard, but important!
>
> This exercise should take about 10 minutes.

> ## Minute Cards (optional alternative)
>
> Please use your minute
> cards (sticky notes or virtual) to give your Trainers anonymous feedback directly.
>
> This exercise should take 5 minutes.

> ## Post Workshop Surveys
>
> Assessment is very important to us! Please take the remaining time to complete
> this [~5 minute post-workshop survey]({{site.instructor_post_survey}}).
