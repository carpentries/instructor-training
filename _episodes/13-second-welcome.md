Yesterday we focused on general aspects of educational psychology and pedagogy. Today we will focus on the specifics of teaching Software and Data Carpentry workshops.
We will look at the lessons that have been written by the Carpentries and discuss how to teach effective workshops. We will review specific
teaching practices we follow at our workshops and practice using some of them. One of the most important practices is live coding. You rarely
find this approach in a current university setting so we'll spend some time practicing this skill. We will conclude our training with a discussion 
about workshop logistics that will help you in preparing to teach your first workshop.  

> ## Questions
> 
> Yesterday we asked you to read some resources about the logistics of teaching and running Carpentry workshops. Please 
> add your questions about logistics and preparation to the Etherpad. We will answer some of these questions now and make sure to 
> answer the rest by the end of the day.
> 
> This discussion take about 5-10 minutes.
