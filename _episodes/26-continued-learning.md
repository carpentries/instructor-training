The drawback of any fast-paced workshop is the danger that
information will never be solidified in long-term memory. We try to mitigate
this by tying concepts together across lessons (i.e. using Unix commands in the
Git lesson, or functions in python and R), but the problem remains. Here, we aim
to give some ideas for encouraging ongoing learning at the institution.

This is a complicated problem to address, as the instructor typically has
little contact with the institution after the workshop apart from surveys.


## Before the workshop

> ## Your Academic Past
>
> Think back to courses or workshops you really liked or didn't like.
> - How did those courses start?
> - Were you confident in the instructors abilities?
> - Did you feel like they were enthusiastic about the course and invested in you?
> - Was it clear what you were going to be learning?
> - Were you excited about the material?
> - Did you leave that first day thinking the instructor was uninterested, that you weren't the learners they wanted to
be teaching or you had no idea what the course was supposed to be about?

When working with the organizers, have a conversation about plans for ongoing learning.
You might ask some of the following questions:
- Is there a computer or data science society at the local college or university?
- Does the local library host any research computing activities?
- Does the host city have a related Meetup gathering?

If the workshop is being held at a university or research institute,
there may be people with expertise who would be willing to assist learners.
Ask the host to consider reaching out to them. They may already have while
identifying possible workshop helpers.

## During the workshop

Take some time to meet with the host, organizers, and helpers. While you cannot
be there to help with the ongoing learning, now is the time to
convey a bit of the Carpentries ethos.  Explain some of the challenges
that will be facing the learners after the workshop, and encourage them
to brainstorm about the most efficient means of post-workshop support.
For some, that could mean starting a Hacky Hour group, where learners meet
on a weekly or bi-weekly basis to apply software carpentry skills to their
own research, help each other on a particular problem.  For other groups, it
may make more sense to partner with an existing effort.

Towards the end of the workshop, address the learners. Let them know that the main
challenge they will face moving ahead with these skills is remembering
all that was contained in the workshop. The workshop is designed to
empower learners to  make their research easier and more effective. This
confidence will wane with time if the skills are not used, and it is all
too easy to let newly-learned skills fall by the wayside.  Remind the
students of all they accomplished over the last two days; reiterate where
the lesson materials can be found, and encourage them to apply
at least one of the skill to their own work within the next few days.  Some examples could be:

- Recreate an Excel chart from a past presentation in R
- Write a lab notebook entry in R-markdown
- Backup a thesis or manuscript by storing it on a version control server
- Log in to a remote machine and run an analysis there


> ## What was your first?
>
> Get into small groups (3-4 people) and discuss the first time you used
> one of the skills taught in one of the Lessons.
>
> 1. What helped you transition from the "old way"?
> 2. What challenges did you have to address when implementing the new skills?
> 3. How did you overcome those challenges?
>
> After 5 minutes, come together, and combine ideas as a large group.
>
> Finally, compare your ideas with the list of topics below.  Did you miss anything?
> Did you come up with something that's not listed below?

## Challenges to Ongoing Learning

We already discussed the primary challenge: solidifying skills in long-term memory.
Other challenges exist as well. Isolation is a major challenge --  in
the workshops, learners are never far from a helper or a peer that can
help them find that missing bracket. Further, learners may feel less
competent because they can only see their struggled, not a room full
of red stickies on their peers computers.

Another challenge may be that the time allotted by supervisors may not be
enough to encourage exploring a new way of doing things (even if the
new way could save many hours in the long run).

## Resources for Stating  a Hacky Hour

Amanda Miotto's [Hacky Hour Handbook](https://github.com/amandamiotto/HackyHourHandbook/blob/master/Introduction.md)
is a great resource for hosts.  This includes detailed information on how to
start a successful Hacky Hour to both support learners and allow them
to share their newfound knowledge.
