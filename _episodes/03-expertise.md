We now discuss what distinguishes expertise
from earlier stages of learning, how being an expert can make it 
more difficult to teach novices, and some tools to help instructors 
identify and overcome these difficulties.  

## What Makes an Expert?  

An [earlier topic]({{ page.root }}/02-practice-learning/) described a key 
difference between novices and competent practitioners. Novices lack a mental model, or have only
a very incomplete model with limited utility.
Competent practitioners 
have mental models that work well enough for most situations. 
How are experts different from both of these groups?

The answer is not that experts know more facts:
competent practitioners can memorize a lot of information
without any noticeable improvement to their performance.  The answer is 
rather that experts have more connections among pieces of knowledge; 
more "short-cuts", if you will.  

One way to illustrate this is to model 
storing knowledge as a graph
in which facts are nodes and relationships are arcs.
(This is emphatically *not* how our brains work,
but it's a useful metaphor.)
The key difference between experts and competent practitioners
is that experts have many more connections among concepts. 
Their mental models are much more densely connected. Therefore 
experts can jump directly from a problem to its solution
because there is a direct link between the two in their mind.
Where a competent practitioner would have to reason 
"A therefore B therefore C therefore D therefore E",
the expert can go from A to E in a single step ("A therefore E").

## Limitations of Expertise  

Because your learners' mental models will likely be less densely connected than your own, 
a conclusion that seems obvious to you will not seem that way to your learners. 
Another feature of expertise that has important consequences for teaching is the
ability of experts to make use of *fluid representations*. Two ways of thinking about a problem
will seem interchangable to an expert, but will not seem that way to a novice. For example, 
someone with experience using the bash shell will be able to change back and forth between absolute and
relative paths with no difficulty and in fact may not even notice they are doing so. A novice learner, 
however, would be confused by this unexplained use of two different ways of representing a concept.

Experts are also better at diagnosing errors than novices or competent practitioners. If faced with an
error message while teaching, an expert will often figure out the cause of the error and devlop a solution
before a novice has even finished reading the error message. Because of this, it is very important
while teaching to be explicit about the process you are using to diagnose and correct errors, even if they
seem trivial to you, as they often will.

Experts are frequently so familiar with their subject
that they can no longer imagine what it's like to *not* see the world that way. 
This is called *expert blind spot* and can lead to what's known as the *expertise-reversal effect* - experts are often 
less good at teaching a subject to novices than people with less expertise
who still remember what it's like to have to learn the things.
This effect can be overcome with training,
but it's part of the reason world-famous researchers are often poor lecturers.

{: .challenge}

The challenge of identifying and working around expert blind spots is one 
reason why we welcome instructors who still identify as "novices"!  Someone 
who is still in the process of learning can be a more effective instructor 
because they are speaking from their own recent experience.  

In these ways and others, the high connectivity of an expert's mental model poses challenges while teaching 
novices. However, that's not to say that experts can't be good teachers.  Experts can 
be effective as long as they take the time to identify and correct 
for their own expert blind spots. You can use some of the exercises we've done while 
preparing to teach to help you overcome these
challenges. 

## Dismissive Language  

Experts often betray their blind spot by using the word "just" in explanations,
as in, "Oh, it's easy, you just fire up a new virtual machine
and then you just install these four patches to Ubuntu
and then you just re-write your entire program in a pure functional style---no problem."
This gives learners the very clear signal
that the instructor thinks their problem is trivial
and that they therefore must be stupid.  

With practice, we can change the way we speak to avoid this type of demotivating language and replace
it with more positive and motivating word choices.

> ## Changing Your Language  
>
> What other words or phrases can have the effect of demotivating learners? What alternatives can we use to
> express this meaning in a positive and motivational way?  
>
> In the Etherpad, make a list of demotivating words/phrases and alternatives.

>> ## Solution  
>> Courtney Seiter lists [10 words and phrases][motivation-words] that can change a conversation: *if*, *could*, *yes*,
>> *together*, *thank you*,
>> *choose to*, *and*, *because*, *willing*, and the person's name. These are motivating words and phrases that can shift mindsets.
>> Jason Fried lists several dirty [four-letter words:][four-letter-words] *need*, *must*, *can’t*, *easy*,
>> *just*, *only*, and *fast*, as well as
>> examples of how they are used to demotivate. Statements like
>> *	"We really need it."
>> *	"If we don’t we can’t ..."
>> *	"Wouldn’t it be easy if we just did it like that?"
>> *	"Can you try it real fast?"
>> can be perceived as dismissive or demeaning or worse.

Another language choice that can have very positive effects on learner mindset is to ask "What questions do people have?" rather than 
"Does anyone have any questions?" Asking "Does anyone have any questions?" can create the impression that you hope people don't have
questions, so that you can continue on with the lesson. By asking what questions people have, you are setting up an expectation that 
people will, indeed, have questions, and that that is normal and expected. 

## You Are Not Your Learners  

One way to overcome these limitations is by understanding the goals 
and motivations of your learners.  We will discuss motivation in more depth 
in a [later lesson]({{ page.root }}/08-motivation/) 
but for now, consider some of these ideas about the typical audience for 
Carpentry workshops.  

- Most scientists' primary goal is not to program, but to do scientific research.
They may not care how hash tables work,
or even that hash tables exist; they just want to know how to process data faster.
We therefore have to make sure that everything we teach is useful right away,
and conversely that we don't teach anything just because it's "fundamental".
- Believing that something will be hard to learn is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
This is why it's important not to say that something is easy:
if someone who has been told that tries it,
and it doesn't work,
they are more likely to become discouraged.

It's also why installing and configuring software is
a much bigger problem for us than experienced programmers like to acknowledge.
It isn't just the time we lose at the start of workshops
as we try to get a Unix shell working on Windows,
or set up a version control client on some idiosyncratic Linux distribution, or ask people to download and unzip files.
It isn't even the unfairness of asking students to debug things
that depend on precisely the knowledge they have come to learn,
but which they don't yet have.
The real problem is that every such failure reinforces the belief that computing is hard,
and that they'd have a better chance of making next Thursday's conference submission deadline
if they kept doing things the way they always have.
For these reasons,
we have adopted a "teach most immediately useful first" approach.
We'll talk much more about this when we discuss 
[motivation]({{ page.root }}/08-motivation/).

## The Important of Practice (Again)  

All of the above points illustrate the importance of using formative assessments frequently. The right 
formative assessment at the right time will give you valuable information about your learners' goals and
motivations, making it easier for you to target your lesson materials to their needs. This strategy also helps
you as an instructor overcome your expert blind spot. It doesn't matter how easy you think a task is, if your
learners aren't getting it, it's probably more complicated than you thought.
