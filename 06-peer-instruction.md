We said earlier that clearing up novices' misconceptions is more important than imparting "mere information".
However,
we also said that when novices misunderstand something,
they can all misunderstand it differently.
How can one instructor clear up the different misconceptions of forty or four hundred people at a time?

No matter how good a teacher you are, you can only pitch a lesson at
one level at a time, and phrase your oration one way at a time. In any
class (but in open-signup workshops especially), students will come
with a very broad distribution of skills and knowledge; the best we
can hope to do with lecture alone is to hit the center of that
distribution. But what about the tails?

The best solution we have so far is called *peer instruction*.
Originally developed by Eric Mazur,
it has been studied extensively in a wide variety of contexts,
including programming.
When it is used,
the basic learning cycle is typically something like this,
to be followed after a short lesson on a single concept:

1.  Give students an MCQ, probing for misconceptions on the topic just
    taught.

2.  Have all the students vote publicly on their answers to the MCQ.

3.  Break the class into groups of 3-4, and have them discuss and debate
    the question within their groups.

4.  Reconvene and have the students vote again.

5.  If necessary, explain the solution to the probelem, have the
    students return to their former groups, and discuss the problem again.

The first two steps of this recipe codify the use of a formative
question to probe for misunderstandings, but the next three steps each
add something more. By getting students to discuss their original
answers, they are compelled to clarify their thinking enough to
verbalize it, which itself can be enough to call out gaps in
reasoning. Re-polling the class then lets the instructor know if they
can move on, or if further explanation is necessary. A final round of
additional discussion after this explanation then serves to give
another chance for strong students to compile their understanding into
something they can deliver as tutoring to their weaker peers.

This has numerous benefits. Our original goal was to make our lesson
more adaptive than we (or any one individual) could be, and offer
multiple different explanations of a concept to maximize students'
chances of getting it; by employing the class, we get as many distinct
explanations & phrasings of a concept as we have students who get
it. Furthermore, those explanations are delivered in a personal and
conversational context, so students who need the extra help get
essentially personal tutoring in situ. What's more, the experience of
teaching gives the stronger students the challenge and opportunity to
make their own understanding so clear and well articulated that it can
be taught to someone else. By infusing peer instruction into our
lessons, we have used those hard-to-reach tails of the skill
distribution to help each other.
