::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Reflect on the course.
- Articulate constructive feedback.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- What can we improve in this training?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge
  
Just as in our technical workshops, we collect feedback at the end of Instructor Training.
This will help your Trainers continue to develop *their* skills and to participate in continually improving our curriculum. The Carpentries Surveys also
provide vital information to The Carpentries Core Team and help us to report to our funders.

## One Up, One Down

Provide one up, one down feedback on the entire Instructor Training course. Remember:

- Say only one thing, and try not to duplicate. This gets harder for those who come later!
- Trainers should try not to respond, only record responses (e.g. in the Etherpad). This is also hard, but important!

This exercise should take about 10 minutes.

## Minute Cards (optional alternative)

Please use your minute
cards (sticky notes or virtual) to give your Trainers anonymous feedback directly.

This exercise should take 5 minutes.

## Post Workshop Surveys

Assessment is very important to us! Please take the remaining time to complete
this [\~5 minute post-workshop survey](https://carpentries.typeform.com/to/cjJ9UP#slug=/).
