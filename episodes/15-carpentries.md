- CK: Not an "official" exercise, but after explaining the workshops and how to run them,
  go around the room, asking each person if they have a question + then answer them.

- Exercise: Creating a Workshop Website
  
  - CK: This takes some time, so some people opt to skip this section.  Inevitably,
    when working with a group of mixed experience with GitHub, some will be able
    to zip through this exercise, where others will struggle.  We **have** gotten
    positive feedback about this exercise as well, where learners felt like it was
    a valuable experience. Can be especially valuable for groups that will probably
    be running workshops on their own (so open trainings, or trainings for folks
    who are ready to get started right away).

- CK: The coffee break after this would be a great time for an "Ask and Offer" if the
  group is interested.

In becoming a certified [Carpentries Instructor](https://carpentries.org/instructors/),
you are also becoming part of a community of like-minded volunteers. Our most
active members draw upon this community for support and mentorship, pursuing goals that
matter to them and creating relationships across the globe.
This section provides some background on
[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) organisation, how we are structured, and a few
ways you might wish to participate (including by teaching workshops!).

## A Brief History

[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) was founded in 1998 with the mission of teaching lab skills for research computing.

[Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/) was founded in 2014 with the mission of building communities teaching universal data literacy.

Also in 2014, [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org/) was founded with the mission of teaching data skills to people working in library- and information-related roles.

On January 1, 2018, Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry merged to form a new project called
[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/)
under the fiscal sponsorship of
[Community Initiatives][CI].
Within this new organisation structure, Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry retained their identities as Lesson Programs of The Carpentries.
On November 1, 2018, The Carpentries governance (formerly known as the Executive Council)
approved [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org/)
as the third official Lesson Program of The Carpentries.

On February 1, 2025, The Carpentries became an independent 501(c)(3) non-profit organisation, now called The Carpentries, Inc. (The Carpentries), governed by a [Board of Directors](https://carpentries.org/about-us/governance/). Non-profit status provides a stable foundation for long-term planning and sustainability. As an independent organisation, The Carpentries has more flexibility in decision-making, program development, and organisational structure, allowing the opportunity to adapt more easily to the changing needs of the community. 

The Carpentries administration and other essential operations are managed by the [Core Team][coreteam-page],
but the majority of our impact is achieved through the efforts of volunteer participants in our global and local communities.
The **global Carpentries community** consists of [Instructors](https://carpentries.org/community/instructors/), [Instructor Trainers](https://carpentries.org/community/instructor-trainers/), [Maintainers](https://carpentries.org/community/maintainers/), [Lesson Developers](https://carpentries.org/community/lesson_developers/), [Institutional Partners](https://carpentries.org/support/membership/member-list/), members of various committees, a [governance structure](https://carpentries.org/governance/), and other supporters who participate, synchronously or asynchronously, in building our programs for all to share. At the **local level**, individual
Carpentries communities may include many participants who are not necessarily connected with or even aware of our global activities, including helpers, learners, faculty sponsors, and others who contribute to keep communities thriving and growing 'on the ground.'

![](fig/The-Carpentries-History-Timeline.png){alt='A graphic depicting the development of The Carpentries. It is titled “A Brief History of The Carpentries” with The Carpentries logo to the left of the title. The graphic is a snaking timeline chart summarising significant transitions in The Carpentries\' history from 1998 to 2025. Not all years are represented. Under each year is a brief summary of the key developments in that year, with logos of the funder organisations that supported that phase of the organisation\'s projects. The dates and accompanying text are as follows: 1998: Software Carpentry is founded by Greg Wilson and Brent Gorda. 2001: Lesson materials are made open source with support from the Python Software Foundation. 2003: Software Carpentry efforts scaled with support from Alfred P. Sloan Foundation & Mozilla Science Lab. 2013: First Software Carpentry for Librarians workshops in US & Canada. 2014: Data Carpentry founded by Karen Cranston, Hilmar Lapp, Tracy Teal, and Ethan White with support from NSF. 2014: James Baker receives support from Software Sustainability Institute to develop and implement Library Carpentry. 2014: Software Carpentry Foundation is founded under NumFOCUS. 2015: Data Carpentry efforts scaled with support from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. 2018: Software Carpentry & Data Carpentry merge to form The Carpentries as a fiscally sponsored project of Community Initiatives. Library Carpentry later joins as a new lesson program. 2019: CZI supports The Carpentries to scale its programs, and build capacity with local communities. 2020: Online Workshops begin. 2025: On 1 February The Carpentries transitions out of fiscal sponsor-ship into an independent 501(c)(3) non-profit organisation.'}

You can learn more about the history and goals of each Lesson Program by reading:

- [Software Carpentry: Lessons Learned][F1000]
- [Data Carpentry: Workshops to Increase Data Literacy for Researchers][IJDC]
- [Library Carpentry: software skills training for library professionals][LIBERQ]

## Similarities and Differences between The Carpentries Lesson Programs

All lesson programs under The Carpentries share the same [core values][values-page].
Their aligned missions are accomplished by running accessible, inclusive training workshops; teaching openly available, high-quality, community-developed lessons; and fostering an active, inclusive, diverse instructor community that promotes and models reproducible research as a community norm.

Similarities between Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry, and Software Carpentry workshops include:

- a focus on technical skills,
- a two full day or four half day format taught by volunteer instructors, and
- a focus on filling gaps in current training for learners.

The major differences between Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry, and Software Carpentry workshops
are their content and intended audience. Their similarities and differences are depicted in this diagram:

![](fig/carpentries-venn-diagram_20200904.svg){alt='Three intersecting circles labelled Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, and Library Carpentry. Software and Data Carpentry both focus on research focused computational skills. Data and Library Carpentry are both domain targeted. Software and Library Carpentry both have a modular curriculum. All three Lesson Programs provide novice-level training, two-day workshops to address gaps in computational skills, taught by volunteer instructors applying Carpentries teaching practices.'}

## What is a Carpentries Workshop? The Rules.

### Using the Names and Logos

The names "Data Carpentry", "Library Carpentry", and "Software Carpentry"
and their respective logos
are all trademarked.
You may only call a workshop a Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry, or Software Carpentry workshop if it meets the requirements outlined on
[The Carpentries website][workshopsreq-page].

Note that as long as you have at least one certified Instructor, the other
instructors and helpers at a branded workshop do not have to be certified. We
rely on your judgment as a certified Instructor to recruit and orient volunteers who
will support you in implementing The Carpentries values and practices. **We do expect you to have at least one co-Instructor and helpers**, even if they are not
certified instructors.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Local Support

The handbook includes several helpful [Workshop Checklists and Suggestions][docs-workshop-checklists]: [https://docs.carpentries.org/resources/workshops/checklists.html](https://docs.carpentries.org/resources/workshops/checklists.html) 

The Helper checklist recommends at least a 1:10
helper-to-learner ratio for in-person workshops (not counting instructors) and more if teaching online.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Materials

All Carpentries lesson
materials are freely available under a permissive [open license](LICENSE.md).
This means that you may use them in contexts outside of a Carpentries workshop (e.g. as material
introduced into a longer course, as a standalone 2-3 hour session, as practice exercises, etc.)
provided you cite the original source.

It is only when you want to run a branded Carpentries workshop using the materials
that the workshop [requirements][workshopsreq-page] are in effect. Other workshops may be described as being "Carpentries-based", using Carpentries materials, etc.

### Reporting a 'Mix and Match' Workshop

If you do decide to self-organise a workshop of any length that does not fit the requirements of a lesson program but does draw from our officially recognised Data Carpentry,
Library Carpentry, or Software Carpentry lessons, we would still like to know about it! This helps us
to better evaluate our impact, and also to understand what the community wants and needs from our materials. You can report your "mix-and-match" workshop to us
(and take advantage of our pre- and post- assessment surveys!) by selecting "Register a self-organised workshop" on our [workshop request page][workshops-form].

At this time we are not seeking registration for lessons taught from The Carpentries Incubator or Carpentries Labs.

### Carpentries Jargon Review

As our community has evolved and its work has emerged, a vocabulary has built up around it. Many of the words we use have common meanings that are
interchangeable elsewhere, but have come to mean very specific things in our community.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Test yourself!

As a class or in groups, see how many of the following terms you can define.

- Lesson
- Episode
- Workshop
- Lesson Program
- Instructor
- (Instructor) Trainer

This should take about 5 minutes.

## How to Organise a Carpentries Workshop Locally

Briefly, there are two types of Carpentries workshops: **centrally-organised** and
**self-organised**. You can read (and hopefully have already read) about these on our [website][workshops-page].

Centrally organised workshops are included in institutional [membership][membership-page] packages and can also be requested separately for a fee. Since The Carpentries
will recruit Instructors to teach, this is a great way to host workshops before your local Instructor team feels fully prepared to run a complete workshop
independently, or to host workshops beyond the areas of expertise you may have locally.

If you have enough local Instructors available to organise your own workshop, you can run a self-organised workshop at any time at no cost.
If you would like to recruit additional Instructors or Helpers, [this blog post][SO-recruiting-blog] has guidelines for using Carpentries communications channels. Registering
your workshop with us allows you to use The Carpentries branding, includes our pre- and post- workshop surveys and results for your workshop, and ensures
that all Instructors and Helpers in our database have the experience recorded in their profile. Registering your workshop also helps us: reporting
on our global impact is vital to our future funding opportunities, allowing us to continue to provide and develop materials and opportunities for you.

Once you have selected your workshop type, consult [**The Carpentries Handbook**][docs] for more resources to support your organising effort.
The Carpentries Handbook is the definitive source for policies and information, including tips, checklists, and points of contact for nearly all
Carpentries-related activities. A few examples of useful content include:

- [template emails and checklists][docs-teach-host] for Hosts, Instructors, and Helpers
- the [instructor no-show policy][docs-noshow] which is important to read before signing up for your first workshop

As The Carpentries grows and changes in response to a complex global legal landscape, our policies and procedures are likely to change. Be sure to check
back for policy changes, and keep in touch on our [communications channels][connect-page] to stay abreast of the latest updates!

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Teaching Opportunities: Local and Global

Many Instructors aim to teach within a local community and do not want to travel. In that case,
you will coordinate with your community to gain access to teaching opportunities through locally organised workshops.

If you want to be presented with opportunities to teach outside your community -- locally or far from home, be sure to join our [Instructors
mailing list][instructors-list]. This is how we recruit Instructors to teach in centrally-organised workshops around the world.

The Carpentries can not guarantee
that all Instructors who respond to recruitment calls will be selected, and depending on your area these opportunities may be scarce.
If you want to get started right away, consider organizing
your own workshop or even teaching a single lesson with a few friends. If your friends have not been through Instructor Training,
you will need to set aside some time to help them understand how best to support your efforts.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Explain to a partner

With a partner, take turns asking and answering the question: "I want to organise a workshop! What will I need to do?" One partner should ask about a
self-organised workshop, and the other can ask about a centrally-organised workshop. If you have a third person, they can help out with follow-up questions
or answers as needed.

When you encounter new questions during this process, be sure to write them in the Etherpad.

Leave about 10 minutes for this discussion.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Setting Out On Your Own... Together: Lesson Incubation

Maybe this instructor training has inspired you to go home and write your
own fantastic lesson!  If you would like to model it after the Software, Data and
Library Carpentry lesson format, you can find two Workbench lesson templates available:

- [Markdown][template-md]: this template is suitable for lessons that serve static content
- [RMarkdown][template-rmd]: this template is suitable for lessons that include executable R code

Any lesson that uses The Carpentries lesson templates follows our [Code of Conduct][coc], 
and is licensed either [CC-BY][cc-by] or [CC-0][cc-0] can be hosted in [The Carpentries Incubator][carpentries-incubator].

The [Collaborative Lesson Development Training][cld] curriculum provides a guide to
the backward design approach we recommend for lesson development. This curriculum is part of our official
teaching offerings; please contact [The Carpentries](mailto:team@carpentries.org) if you are interested in taking
this course.

## A Culture of Contribution

In the same way we hope to promote research practices that are open, collaborative,
and reproducible through our technical training, The
Carpentries community aims to embody a culture of openness, sharing, and
continual pursuit of best practices. We draw together the collective expertise of
all who join us to collaborate on new lessons, share resources,
and maintain our lessons with small and large fixes and improvements as we go.

When you join our community by contributing, you join an amazing group of people. Whether you are contributing
through our repositories, communications channels, or by joining a meeting or taking on a role, you will find
other people like you who care about The Carpentries [core values][values-page] and want to make a difference. Your efforts,
small and large, will combine with theirs to make the work of this organisation possible.

Whatever your interests or strengths, we hope you will find a place where you can grow with us!

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge
