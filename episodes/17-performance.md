Continuing our theme of developing practical Carpentries teaching skills,
this section provides another chance to practice live coding, to go through the
process of observing and giving feedback, and to make changes to how we teach based on the feedback of others. 

> ## Round Two
> First, have a look at the [rubric]({{ page.root }}/demos_rubric/) that is given to trainers as a suggested framework for evaluating the online teaching demonstration sessions that are part of instructor checkout.
> Does this rubric make sense? Take a moment to think about things you'd like to do differently with your next live coding
> practice. This is also a good time to ask questions about teaching demonstration.
>
> Next, get back into the same groups you did your live coding with.
> Take turns re-teaching your chosen live coding session, making sure to incorporate changes based on the feedback you received and any new ideas based on reading the rubric.
> This time, give feedback to each
> other using the [checkout rubric]({{ page.root }}/demos_rubric/) you just discussed. When you are finished, add some thoughts on this process to the Etherpad:
> What did you change? Did it work better or worse with the change? How might you do it if you were to teach it again?
>
>  This exercise should take about 25 minutes for teaching, plus 20 minutes for pre and post discussion.
