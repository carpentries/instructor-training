## Introductions

To begin your class, the instructors should give a brief introduction
that will convey their capacity to teach the material,
accessibility/approachability, desire for student success, and
enthusiasm.  Tailor your introduction to the students’ skill level so
that you convey competence (without seeming too advanced) and
demonstrate that you can relate to the students.  Throughout the
workshop, continually demonstrate that you are interested in student
progress and that you are enthusiastic about the topics.

Students should also introduce themselves (preferably verbally).  At
the very least, everyone should add their name to the Etherpad, but
its also good for everyone at a given site to know who all is in the
group.  Note: this can be done while setting up before the start of
the class.

## Workshop Overview

This two-day workshop has two goals:

*   Introduce participants to a handful of key educational research
    findings and show how they can be used to help people learn better
    and faster.

*   Introduce participants to the teaching practices that have been
    adopted by the Software and Data Carpentry communities, and the
    overall philosophy and procedures of both organizations in order
    to prepare them to teach at Software and Data Carpentry workshops.

During the insturctor-training workshop students will listen to short
lessons, participate in individual and group practical exercises,
practice teaching, and give critical feedback to their peers.

After completing the instructor-training workshop,
participants must complete
[these follow-up exercises online]({{ site.github.url }}/checkout/)
in order to be certified to teach Software Carpentry and/or Data Carpentry.
This will be discussed in more detail at the end of Day 2.

All participants in this course are required to abide by our code of conduct.

There are no specific prerequisites for this training, but
participants will benefit from having been through a Data Carpentry or
Software Carpentry workshop so that they are familiar with our
teaching techniques. In particular, participants are not required to
have any specific programming skills (though of course they should
know enough about the subjects of one or more of our lessons to be
able to teach them). We do not cover the content of Data Carpentry and
Software Carpentry workshops in this training, both because there are
too many workshop modules to cover in two days, and because you are
expected to brush up on the relevant skills for your workshop prior to
teaching. Rather than covering specific workshop content, this
training will focus on developing teaching skills that are broadly
useful across all of our lessons.

## Assessing Trainee Motivation and Prior Knowledge

It’s important to first assess the prior knowledge of the workshop
participants because this will influence (to some extent) how you
motivate the activities and how you communicate with the attendees.
For instance, participants who have taken or helped with a workshop
will have a much better concept of what goes on during a workshop than
those who have never experienced one.  Furthermore, someone who live
codes frequently and someone who has never live coded will experience
the live coding activities differently.

Now that we have a better idea of everyone's prior knowledge and
familiarity with some of the SWC and DC teaching practices, we're
ready to begin our training. Our goal is that by the end, you will
have acquired some knew knowledge, confidence, and skills that you can
use in your teaching practice in general and in teaching SWC and DC
workshops specifically.

Let's dive into the theory and practice behind designing multiple
choice questions.
