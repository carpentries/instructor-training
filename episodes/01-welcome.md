## Code of Conduct

To make clear what is expected, everyone participating in Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry activities is required
to conform to our Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by Software Carpentry
and Data Carpentry including, but not limited to workshops, email lists, online forums and on GitHub. Please review
[the Code of Conduct](https://software-carpentry.org/conduct/) to familiarise yourself with it.

## Introductions

> Introductions set the stage for learning.
> — Tracy Teal, Executive Director, The Carpentries

Hello everyone, and welcome to the Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry
instructor training.  We're very pleased to have you with us.

> ## Information for Today's Trainers
>
> To begin your class, each Trainer should give a brief introduction that will convey (a) their capacity to teach the material, (b) accessibility/approachability, (c) desire for student success, and (d) enthusiasm. Tailor your introduction to the learners’ skill level so that you convey competence (without seeming too advanced) and demonstrate that you can relate to the learners. Throughout the workshop, continually demonstrate that you are interested in student progress and that you are enthusiastic about the topics.

> ## Information for Today's Learners
>
> 1. Add your name to the Etherpad
> 1. Introduce yourselves (preferably verbally)! In your introduction, (a) explain your work in 3 words and (b) say something you are proud of (not necessarily related to research or teaching).
{: .discussion}

> ## Our First Exercise
>
> In the Etherpad, write down your name, the best class you ever
> took (or one class from your top ten, if you can't decide), and
> what made it so great.
> This exercise should take about 2 minutes.

Most of you are probably here because you have attended or helped at
a Software or Data Carpentry workshop.  To make sure everyone has the
same context, we'll give a brief overview of the Software and Data
Carpentry organizations.

## A Brief Overview of the Carpentries

Software and Data Carpentry are
both communities of volunteer researchers, educators, and more who develop
lessons and teach two day workshops on basic computing and data skills for
researchers.  Software Carpentry focuses on helping researchers develop foundational 
computational skills; Data Carpentry focuses on helping
researchers work effectively with their data through its lifecycle.

The main goal of these organizations is not to teach specific skills, per se - although those
are covered - but rather, to convey best practices that will enable
researchers to be more productive and do better research.


## Instructor Training Workshop Overview

We will not be going
over the workshop content in detail (although you will get familiarity with
some of the content through the exercises), but instead we will
focus on developing teaching skills that are broadly
useful across all of our lessons. This two-day training is the first step in becoming a certified
Software and/or Data Carpentry instructor.
The follow-up steps for certification will require that you dig into the workshop content yourself. We'll talk about that more tomorrow afternoon.

To orient yourself, there is a schedule on the workshop webpage which is linked through this workshop's Etherpad.

### How Learning Works

One of our main emphases will be discussing the "best practices" of teaching. We
will be introducing you to a handful of key educational research
findings and demonstrating how they can be used to help people learn better and faster.

### Building Teaching Skill

Just like learning a new language, a musical instrument, 
or a sport, teaching is a skill that requires practice and feedback.  
We will have many opportunities to practice and give each other feedback throughout this workshop.
We welcome questions and dialogue
at any point. We'll be using the Etherpad to help facilitate discussion. 
Please feel free to ask questions verbally or to put them into the notes or chat box 
of the Etherpad.

### Creating a Positive Learning Environment

One part of making this a productive two days for all of us is a
community effort to treat one another with kindness and respect.  This
training, as in all Software/Data Carpentry workshops is subject to
the Software and Data Carpentry Code of Conduct.  We will be able to
give our best effort (and have the most fun!) if everyone abides by these guidelines. 
We will also be discussing and practicing teaching techniques to create a positive and 
welcoming environment in your classrooms.

### Carpentry History and Culture

We will be introducing you to the teaching practices that have been
adopted by the Software and Data Carpentry communities, and our
overall philosophy and procedures in order
to prepare you to teach Carpentry workshops.
The greatest asset of the Carpentries is people like
yourselves - people who want to help researchers learn about these ideas
and share their own experience and enthusiasm.  We hope that this training
gives everyone a chance to meet new people and share ideas.

## Assessing Trainee Motivation and Prior Knowledge

It's important to first assess the prior knowledge of the workshop
participants because this will influence (to some extent) how you
motivate the activities and how you communicate with the attendees.

> ## Background
>
> *Have you ever participated in a Software Carpentry or Data Carpentry Workshop?*
>
> 1.  Yes, I have taken a workshop.
> 2.  Yes, I have been a workshop helper.
> 3.  Yes, I organized a workshop.
> 4.  No, but I am familiar with what is taught at a workshop.
> 5.  No, and I am not familiar with what is taught at a workshop.
>
> *Which of these most accurately describes your teaching experience?*
>

>
> This exercise should take about 3 minutes.

Now that we have a better idea of everyone's prior knowledge and
familiarity with some of the key Carpentry teaching practices, we're
ready to begin our training. Our goal is that by the end, you will
have acquired some new knowledge, confidence, and skills that you can
use in your teaching practice in general and in teaching Carpentry
workshops specifically.
