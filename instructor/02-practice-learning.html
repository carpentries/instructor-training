<p>We will now get started with a discussion of how learning works. We
will begin with some key concepts from educational research and identify
how these principles are put into practice in Carpentries workshops.</p>
<section><h2 class="section-heading" id="the-carpentries-pedagogical-model">The Carpentries Pedagogical Model<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-carpentries-pedagogical-model"></a></h2>
<hr class="half-width"><p>The Carpentries aims to teach computational competence to learners.
We take an applied approach, avoiding the theoretical and general in
favour of the practical and specific. By showing learners how to solve
specific problems with specific tools and providing hands-on practice,
we develop learners’ confidence and lay the foundation for future
learning.</p>
<p>A critical component of this process is that learners are able to
practice what they are learning in real time, get feedback on what they
are doing, and then apply those lessons learned to the next step in the
learning process. Having learners help each other during the workshops
also helps to reinforce concepts taught during the workshops.</p>
<p><strong>A Carpentries workshop is an interactive event</strong> – for
learners and instructors. We give and receive feedback throughout the
course of a workshop. We incorporate assessments within the lesson
materials and ask for feedback on sticky notes during lunch breaks and
at the end of each day.</p>
<p>One reason why practice and feedback are so important is because a
Carpentries workshop is not simply a source of information: It is the
starting point for development of a new skill. To understand what this
means, we will start by exploring what research tells us about skill
acquisition and development of a “mental model.”</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="the-acquisition-of-skill">The Acquisition of Skill<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-acquisition-of-skill"></a></h2>
<hr class="half-width"><p>Our approach is based on the work of researchers like Patricia
Benner, who applied the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition" class="external-link">Dreyfus
model of skill acquisition</a> in her studies of <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0270467604265061" class="external-link">how
nurses progress from novice to expert</a> (<a href="https://www.worldcat.org/search?q=au%3ABenner%2C+Patricia+E." class="external-link">see
also books by Benner</a>). This work indicates that through practice and
formal instruction, learners acquire skills and advance through distinct
stages. In simplified form, three stages of this model are:</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/skill-level.svg" alt='Three people, labeled from left to right as "Novice", "Competent Practitioner", and "Expert". Underneath,an arrow labelled "Experience level" points from left to right. The "Novice" is quoted, "I am not sure what questions to ask." The Competent Practitioner is quoted, "I am pretty confident, but I still look stuff up a lot!" The Expert is quoted "I have been doing this on a daily basis for years!"' class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><ul><li>
<p><em>Novice</em>: someone who does not know what they do not know,
i.e., they do not yet know what the key ideas in the domain are or how
they relate. Novices may have difficulty formulating questions, or may
ask questions that seem irrelevant or off-topic as they rely on prior
knowledge, without knowing what is or is not related yet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: A <em>novice</em> learner in a Carpentries workshop might
never have heard of the bash shell, and therefore may have no
understanding of how it relates to their file system or other programs
on their computer.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Competent practitioner</em>: someone who has enough
understanding for everyday purposes. They will not know all the details
of how something works and their understanding may not be entirely
accurate, but it is sufficient for completing normal tasks with normal
effort under normal circumstances.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: A <em>competent practitioner</em> in a Carpentries workshop
might have used the shell before and understand how to move around
directories and use individual programs, but they might not understand
how they can fit these programs together to build scripts and automate
large tasks.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Expert</em>: someone who can easily handle situations that
are out of the ordinary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: An <em>expert</em> in a Carpentries workshop may have
experience writing and running shell scripts and, when presented with a
problem, immediately sees how these skills can be used to solve the
problem.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul><p>Note that how a person <em>feels</em> about their skill level is not
included in these definitions! You may or may not consider yourself an
expert in a particular subject, but may nonetheless function at that
level in certain contexts. We will come back to the expertise of the
Instructor and its impact – positive and negative – on teaching, in the
next episode. For now, we are primarily concerned with novices, as this
is The Carpentries’ primary target audience.</p>
<p>It is common to think of a novice as a sort of an “empty vessel” into
which knowledge can be “poured.” Unfortunately, this analogy includes
inaccuracies that can generate dangerous misconceptions. In our next
section, we will briefly explore the nature of “knowledge” through a
concept that helps us differentiate between novices and competent
practitioners in a more useful and visual way. This, in turn, will have
implications for how we teach.</p>

<p>Understanding is never a mirror of reality, even for an expert;
rather, it is an internal representation based on our experience with a
subject. This internal representation is often described as a
<strong>mental model</strong>. A mental model allows us to extrapolate,
or make predictions beyond and between the narrow limits of experience
and memory, filling in gaps to the point that things “make sense.”</p>
<p>As we learn, our mental model evolves to become more complex and,
most importantly, more useful. A useful model makes reasonable
predictions and fits well within the range of things we are likely to
encounter. While there will always be inaccuracies – or “misconceptions”
– these do not interfere with day-to-day functioning. A useful model
does not seize up or break down entirely as new concepts are added.</p>

<h3 id="the-power-and-limitations-of-analogies">The power (and limitations) of analogies<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-power-and-limitations-of-analogies"></a></h3>
<p>Some mental models can be succinctly summarised by comparison to
something else that is more universally understood. Good analogies can
be extraordinarily useful when teaching, because they draw upon an
existing mental model to fill in another, speeding learning and making a
memorable connection. However, all analogies have limitations! If you
choose to use an analogy, be sure its usefulness outweighs its potential
to generate misconceptions that may interfere with learning.</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>People often ask where our name came from. Greg Wilson has this to
say:</p>
<p>“Brent Gorda and I came up with the name in 1998 to differentiate
what we were teaching from software engineering. That’s about digging
the Channel Tunnel; we’re about the computational equivalent of hanging
drywall.”</p>
<p>The word “carpentry” acts as a metaphor – a type of analogy –
inspiring a comparison with something concrete, hands on, practical, and
useful. This clearly conveys the purpose of our organisation: to support
computational skill development among working practitioners who need the
right tools and practices to be effective day to day.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>A mental model may be represented as a collection of concepts and
facts, connected by relationships. The mental model of an expert in any
given subject will be far larger and more complex than that of a novice,
including both more concepts and more detailed and numerous
relationships. However, <strong>both may be perfectly useful</strong> in
certain contexts.</p>
<p>Returning to our example levels of skill development:</p>
<ul><li>A <em>novice</em> has a minimal mental model of surface features of
the domain. Inaccuracies based on limited prior knowledge may interfere
with adding new information. Predictions are likely to borrow heavily
from mental models of other domains which seem superficially
similar.</li>
<li>A <em>competent practitioner</em> has a mental model that is useful
for everyday purposes. Most new information they are likely to encounter
will fit well with their existing model. Even though many potential
elements of their mental model may still be missing or wrong,
predictions about their area of work are usually accurate.</li>
<li>An <em>expert</em> has a densely populated and connected mental
model that is especially good for problem solving. They quickly connect
concepts that others may not see as being related. They may have
difficulty explaining how they are thinking in ways that do not rely on
other features unique to their own mental model.</li>

<p>Most people do not naturally visualise a mental model as a diagram of
concepts and relationships. Mental models are complicated! Yet, visual
representation of concepts and relationships can be a useful way to
explore and understand hidden features of a mental model.</p>
<p>There are certain ways in which you may routinely use visual
organisers, such as flow charts or biochemical pathway diagrams. A more
general tool that is useful for exploring any network of concepts and
relationships is a <strong>concept map</strong>. Pioneered for classroom
use by John Novak in the 1970s, a concept map asks you to identify which
concepts are most relevant to a topic at hand and – critically – to
identify how they are connected. It can be quite difficult to identify
and organise these connections! However, the process of forcing abstract
knowledge into a visual format can force you to name connections that
you might otherwise have quietly assumed, or illuminate gaps that you
may not have been aware of. Especially where analogies are not
available, concept mapping can help you to make your mental model of a
concept more clear to yourself or others.</p>
<p>As an example, consider a mental model of the relationship between a
small ball and water in a full glass.</p>
<p>The concept map below illustrates a simple mental model that a young
child might develop after putting the ball in the water.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/ballwater1a.svg" alt='Two words inside rectangles, with labeled arrows connecting them. "Ball" is at the left, with an arrow pointing to "Water", at right, labeled as "Pushes out."' class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>Give a child balls of three different sizes, and they might put
together a somewhat more complex mental model, perhaps illustrated
as:</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/ballwater2a.svg" alt='Four words inside rectangles, with labeled arrows connecting them. "Ball" is at the left, and "Water", at right.

<hr class="half-width"><p>The mental model above connects a ball to the water it can displace,
recognizing that ‘more’ ball can move ‘more’ water. This mental model is
perfectly functional for a child who wants to have fun splashing water
around. It may endure in this way for several years of beaches and
bathtubs.</p>
<p>However, when this child is asked to predict what would happen to the
water if a ball were not bigger or smaller but <em>heavier</em> or
<em>lighter</em>, they will naturally apply their existing mental model
to the task. BUT…</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/ballwater3a.svg" alt='A concept map similar to the previous one except with "Heavy Ball" and "Light Ball" in the middle, and a red "X" over the arrows labeled "Pushes out MORE" and "Pushes out LESS"' class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>What a surprise! The challenge presented by this new information is
that it clashes with the pre-existing mental model, to which it seemed
to apply. This prior knowledge needs to be adjusted to a new
understanding that incorporates the difference between properties of
mass and volume.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/ballwater4a.svg" alt='A new concept map. "Ball" remains at left, and "Water", at right. "Size" and "Weight" are stacked vertically between them. Arrows from "Ball" share the label "Can have more or less." One arrow from "size to "water" is labeled "Affects pushing of"' class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>When mental models break, learning can occur more slowly than you
might expect. The longer a prior model was in use, and the more
extensively it has to be <em>unlearned</em>, the more it can actively
interfere with the incorporation of new knowledge. Our child may quickly
adapt to this new information if they had never thought much about mass
before and were simply trying out an existing mental model on a new
situation. However, if they had extensive experience with balls that
were both larger and heavier (for example), it may take longer to
unlearn what they thought they understood about mass.</p>
<p>Most mental models worth mapping are not so simple. Yet, forcing
complex ideas in to this simplified format can be useful when preparing
to teach, because it forces you to be explicit about exactly what
concepts are at the heart of your topic, and to name relationships
between them.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="types-of-misconceptions">Types of Misconceptions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#types-of-misconceptions"></a></h3>
<p>Correcting learners’ misconceptions is at least as important as
presenting them with correct information. There are many ways of
classifying different types of misconceptions. For our purposes, it is
useful to consider 3 broad categories:</p>
<ul><li>Simple <em>factual errors</em>. These exist in isolation from any
deeper understanding. These are the easiest to correct. Example:
believing that Vancouver is the capital of British Columbia.</li>
<li>
<em>Broken models</em>. These occur when inaccuracies explain
relationships and generate predictions (often successfully!) in an
existing mental model. These take time to address, demanding that
learners reason carefully through examples to see contradictions.
Examples: believing that motion and acceleration must always be in the
same direction, or that seasons are related to the shape of the earth’s
orbit.</li>
<li>
<em>Fundamental beliefs</em>, which are deeply connected to a
learner’s social identity and are the hardest to change. Examples: “the
world is only a few thousand years old” or “human beings cannot affect
the planet’s climate”. “I am not a computational person” may, arguably,
also fall into this category of misconception.</li>
</ul><p>The middle category of misconceptions is the most useful type to
watch out for in Carpentries workshops. While teaching, we want to
expose learners’ broken models so that we can help them begin to
deconstruct them and build better ones in their place.</p>

<hr class="half-width"><p>In order to effectively root out pre-existing misconceptions that
need to be un-learned and stop quietly developing misconceptions in
their tracks, an Instructor needs to be actively and persistently
looking for them. But how?</p>
<p>Like so many challenges we will discuss in this training, the answer
is <strong>feedback</strong>. In this case, we want feedback that allows
us to <strong>assess</strong> the developing mental model of a trainee
in highly specific ways, to verify that learning is proceeding according
to plan and not careening off in some unpredicted direction. We want to
get this feedback <strong>while we teach</strong> so that we can respond
to that information and adapt our instruction to get learners back on
track.</p>
<p>This kind of assessment has a name: it is called <strong>formative
assessment</strong> because it is applied during learning to form the
practice of teaching and the experience of the learner. This is
different from exams, for example, which sum up what a participant has
learned but are not used to guide further progress and are hence called
<strong>summative</strong>.</p>
<p>Feedback from formative assessment illuminates misconceptions for
both Instructors and learners. It also provides reassurance on both
sides when learning <em>is</em> proceeding on track! It is far more
reliable than reading faces or using feelings of comfort as a metric,
which tends to be what Instructors and learners default to
otherwise.</p>

<p>Formative assessments can serve many purposes other than hunting down
misconceptions, such as verifying engagement or supporting memory
consolidation. We will discuss some of these functions in later
episodes. In this section, we are interested quite narrowly in
evaluating mental models.</p>
<p>One example of formative assessment that can be used to tease out
misconceptions is the multiple choice question (MCQ). When designed
carefully, these can target anticipated misconceptions with surgical
precision. For example, suppose we are teaching children multi-digit
addition. A well-designed MCQ would be:</p>
<pre class="source"><code>Q: what is 27 + 15 ?
a) 42
b) 32
c) 312
d) 33</code></pre>
<p>The correct answer is 42, but each of the other answers provides
valuable insight.</p>

<p>Designing a few MCQs with diagnostic power is useful when preparing
to teach even if they are never used, for the same reason that concept
mapping can be useful: it forces the instructor to think about the
learners’ mental models and try to anticipate how they might be broken.
In short, it helps Instructors to put themselves into the learners’
heads and see the topic from their point of view. We will talk more
about the process of preparing to teach in a later episode.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="the-importance-of-going-slowly">The Importance of Going Slowly<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-importance-of-going-slowly"></a></h2>
<hr class="half-width"><p>It takes work to actively assess mental models throughout a workshop;
this also takes time. This can make Instructors feel conflicted about
using formative assessment routinely. However, the need to conduct
routine assessment is not the only reason why a workshop <strong>should
proceed more slowly than you think</strong>.</p>
<p>One key insight from research on cognitive development is that
novices, competent practitioners, and experts each need to be taught
differently. In particular, presenting novices with a pile of facts
early on is counter-productive, because they do not yet have a model or
framework to fit those facts into. In fact, <strong>presenting too many
facts too soon can actually reinforce an incorrect mental
model</strong>. (This is a key problem with the “empty vessel” analogy
described earlier.)</p>
<p>Most learners coming to Carpentries lessons are novices, and do not
have a strong mental model of the concepts we are teaching. Thus, our
primary goal is <strong>not</strong> to teach the syntax of a particular
programming language, but <strong>to help them construct a working
mental model</strong> so that they have something to attach facts to. In
other words, our goal is to teach people <strong>how to think</strong>
about programming and data management in a way that will allow them to
learn more easily on their own or understand what they might find
online.</p>

<p>If someone feels it is too slow, they will be a bit bored. If they
feel it is too fast, they will never come back to programming. — Kunal
Marwaha, SWC Instructor</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>If our goal is to help novices construct an accurate and useful
mental model of a new intellectual domain, this will impact our
teaching. For example, we principally want to help learners form the
right categories and make connections among concepts. We <em>do not</em>
want to overload them with a slew of unrelated facts, as this will be
confusing.</p>
<p>An important practical implication of this latter point is the pace
at which we teach.<br>
In the first main episode of Software Carpentry’s <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/" class="external-link">lesson on the Unix
shell</a>, which covers “Navigating Files and Directories”, there are
only four “commands” for 40 minutes of teaching. Ten minutes per command
may seem glacially slow, but that episodes’s real purpose is to teach
learners about paths; later on, they will learn about history,
wildcards, pipes and filters, command-line arguments, redirection, and
all the other big ideas on which the shell depends, and without which
people cannot understand how to use commands.</p>
<p>That mental model of the shell also includes things like:</p>
<ul><li>Anything you repeat manually, you will eventually get wrong (so let
the computer repeat things for you by using tab completion and the
<code>history</code> command).</li>
<li>Lots of little tools, combined as needed, are more productive than a
handful of programs. (This motivates the pipe-and-filter model.)</li>
</ul><p>These two examples illustrate something else as well. Learning
consists of more than “just” adding information to mental models;
creating linkages between concepts and facts is at least as important.
Telling people that they should not repeat things, and that they should
try to think (by analogy) in terms of little pieces loosely joined, both
set the stage for discussing functions. Explicitly referring back to
pipes and filters in the shell when introducing functions helps solidify
both ideas.</p>

building an inclusive learning environment, and continually getting (and
