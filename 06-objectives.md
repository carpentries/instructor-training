## Writing Learning Objectives

Summative and formative assessments help instructors figure out what they're going to teach,
but in order to communicate that to learners and other instructors,
we should also write *learning objectives*.
It's easy to come up with fuzzy ones like,
"Learners will gain an appreciation of the role of research software engineers in the research process."
Useful ones take a bit more work.

What we want are specific, verifiable descriptions of what learners can do to demonstrate their learning.
Each learning objective should have *a measurable or verifiable verb* specifying what the learner will do,
and should specify the *criteria for acceptable performance*.
For example,
a better learning objective than the one above would be,
"Learners will list three things that make research software engineers distinct from
other specialists involved in the research process."

In order to formulate good learning objectives we need to decide what kinds of learning we are aiming for.
There is a difference between knowing the atomic weight of fluorine
and understanding what elements it's likely to bond with and why.
Similarly,
there's a difference between being able to figure out why a microscope isn't focusing properly
and being able to design a new microscope that focuses more easily.
What we need is a taxonomy of understanding
that is hierarchical, measurable, stable, and cross-cultural.

The best-known attempt to build one is
[Bloom's taxonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom's_taxonomy),
which was first published in 1956.
More recent efforts are Wiggins and McTighe's *facets of understanding*
and Fink's taxonomy from his book
*[Creating Significant Learning Experiences](http://www.amazon.com/Creating-Significant-Learning-Experiences-Integrated/dp/1118124251/)*.
The table below compares them and shows some of the verbs typically used
in learning objectives written for each level.

Baume's guide to
[writing and using good learning outcomes](papers/baume-learning-outcomes-2009.pdf)
is a good longer discussion of these issues.

## Who Are Our Learners?

The complement to clarifying the objectives for our lessons
is to be clear about who we're trying to teach.
One *[well-known scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_styles#Learning_modalities)*
characterizes learners as visual, auditory, or kinesthetic
according to whether they like to see things, hear things, or do things.
These classifications are easy to understand,
but are [almost certainly pseudoscience](http://www.amazon.com/Great-Myths-Brain-Psychology/dp/1118312716/):
what little evidence exists for them is very weak.

Another classification scheme developed by Honey and Mumford is based on an idealized learning cycle.
It is also frequently criticized,
but provides a more useful vocabulary for describing interactions with learners.
The four stages in the cycle are:

1.  *doing* something or having an experience,
2.  *reflecting* on the experience,
3.  *concluding* from the experience (i.e., developing an explanatory theory), and
4.  *planning* the next steps to apply or test the theory.

Different learners prefer to start with or spend more time in
different parts of this cycle.
This leads naturally to a four-way division:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Learn best when</th>
    <th>Learn less when</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Activist</th>

    <td>
      <ul>
	<li>there is no apparent pay-back to the learning</li>
        <li>the event or learning is "all theory"</li>

        <li>they do not see sufficient reward from the learning activity</li>
      </ul>
    </td>

## Learner Profiles

Another way to characterize the audience for a course is to write *learner profiles*.
This technique is borrowed from user interface design,
where short profiles of typical users are created
to help designers think about their audience's needs,
and to give them a shorthand for talking about specific cases.

Learner profiles have three parts:
the person's general background,
the problem they face,
and how the course will help them.
A learner profile for Software Carpentry might be:

> João is an agricultural engineer doing his masters in soil physics.
> His programming experience is a first year programming course using C.
> He was never able to use this low-level programming into his activities,
> and never programmed after the first year.
>
> His work consists of evaluating physical properties of soil samples from different conditions.
> Some of the soil properties are measured by an automated device that sends logs in a text format to his machine.
> João has to open each file in Excel,
> crop the first and last quarters of points,
> and calculate an average.
>
> Software Carpentry will show João how to write shell scripts to count the lines and crop the right range for each file,
> and how to use R to read these files and calculate the required statistics.
> It will also show him how to put his programs and files under version control
> so that he can re-run analyses and figure out which results may have been affected by changes.
