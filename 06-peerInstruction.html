<p>We said earlier that clearing up novices' misconceptions is more important than imparting &quot;mere information&quot;. However, we also said that when novices misunderstand something, they can all misunderstand it differently. How can one instructor clear up the different misconceptions of forty or four hundred people at a time?</p>
<p>No matter how good a teacher you are, you can only pitch a lesson at one level at a time, and phrase your oration one way at a time. In any class (but in open-signup workshops especially), students will come with a very broad distribution of skills and knowledge; the best we can hope to do with lecture alone is to hit the center of that distribution. But what about the tails?</p>
<p>The best solution we have so far is called <em>peer instruction</em>. Originally developed by Eric Mazur, it has been studied extensively in a wide variety of contexts, including programming. When it is used, the basic learning cycle is typically something like this, to be followed after a short lesson on a single concept:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Give students an MCQ, probing for misconceptions on the topic just taught.</p></li>
<li><p>Have all the students vote publicly on their answers to the MCQ.</p></li>
<li><p>Break the class into groups of 3-4, and have them discuss and debate the question within their groups.</p></li>
<li><p>Reconvene and have the students vote again.</p></li>
<li><p>If necessary, explain the solution to the probelem, have the students return to their former groups, and discuss the problem again.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The first two steps of this recipe codify the use of a formative question to probe for misunderstandings, but the next three steps each add something more. By getting students to discuss their original answers, they are compelled to clarify their thinking enough to verbalize it, which itself can be enough to call out gaps in reasoning. Re-polling the class then lets the instructor know if they can move on, or if further explanation is necessary. A final round of additional discussion after this explanation then serves to give another chance for strong students to compile their understanding into something they can deliver as tutoring to their weaker peers.</p>
<p>This has numerous benefits. Our original goal was to make our lesson more adaptive than we (or any one individual) could be, and offer multiple different explanations of a concept to maximize students' chances of getting it; by employing the class, we get as many distinct explanations &amp; phrasings of a concept as we have students who get it. Furthermore, those explanations are delivered in a personal and conversational context, so students who need the extra help get essentially personal tutoring in situ. What's more, the experience of teaching gives the stronger students the challenge and opportunity to make their own understanding so clear and well articulated that it can be taught to someone else. By infusing peer instruction into our lessons, we have used those hard-to-reach tails of the skill distribution to help each other.</p>
