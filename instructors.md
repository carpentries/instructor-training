## Logistics

This course has been taught as a multi-week online class,
as a two-day in-person class,
and as a two-day class in which the learners are in co-located groups
and the instructor participates remotely.

### Multi-Week Online

This was the first method we tried.

*   We meet every week or every second week for an hour using Google Hangout or BlueJeans.
    Each meeting is held twice (or even three times) to accommodate learners' time zones
    and because video conferencing systems can't handle 60+ people at once.
    Each meeting also uses an Etherpad for shared note-taking,
    and more importantly for asking and answering questions:
    having several dozen people try to talk on a call hasn't worked,
    so in most sessions,
    the instructor does the talking
    and learners respond through the Etherpad chat.

*   Learners post homework online, then comment on each other's work.
    *   We used a WordPress blog for the first ten rounds of training.
        People found writing and commenting on posts straightforward,
	but setting up dozens of logins was tedious.
    *   We tried a GitHub-backed blog in the Winter 2015 class.
        It didn't work nearly as well:
	a third of the participants found it extremely frustrating,
	and post-publication commentary was awkward.
    *   We tried Piazza in the Fall 2015 class.
        It was better than GitHub,
	but still not as good as a simple WordPress blog.
	In particular,
	it was hard to find things once there were more than a dozen homework categories.

### Two-Day In-Person

This was the second method we tried.
The biggest change was the introduction of recorded teaching exercises.

*   Several times during the training,
    participants are divided into groups of three
    and asked to teach a short lesson (typically 2-3 minutes long).
    In turn,
    one person is the teacher, one the audience, and one the videographer,
    who records the teacher using a handheld device such as a phone.
    Group members then rotate roles:
    the teacher becomes the listener, the listener records, and the videographer teaches.
    Once all three have finished teaching,
    the group reviews all three videos,
    and everyone gives feedback on everyone (including themselves).
    This feedback then goes into the Etherpad for discussion.

*   It's important to record all three videos and then watch all three:
    if the cycle is teach-review-teach-review,
    the last person to teach runs out of time.
    Doing all the reviewing after all the teaching
    also helps put a bit of distance between the teaching and the reviewing,
    which makes the exercise slightly less excruciating.

*   This exercise only works if there are breakout rooms available:
    if everyone is trying to record in the same room,
    the audio cross-talk makes the recordings unintelligible.

*   We use Etherpad for in-person training,
    both for note-taking and for posting exercise solutions and feedback on recorded lessons
    Questions and discussion are done aloud.

### Two-Day Online With Groups

*   We use Google Hangouts and Etherpad as in the multi-week version.
    Each group of learners is together in a room using one camera and microphone,
    rather than each being on the call separately.
    We have found that having good audio matters more than having good video,
    and that the better the audio,
    the more learners can communicate with the instructor and other rooms by voice
    rather than by using the Etherpad chat.

*   We do the video lecture exercise as in the two-day in-person training.

    *   16:00: Close
*   Day 2
    *   09:00: Questions based on operations guide and Teaching Perspectives Inventory
    *   10:00: Live coding demo => live coding practice on same lesson + coffee (in either order)
    *   11:00: Review live coding
    *   11:15: Motivation and demotivation => write your story over lunch
    *   11:45: Minute cards for morning session
    *   12:00: Lunch
    *   13:00: Discussion; setting up a workshop website
    *   13:45: Discussion of how to tell what effect we're having => develop assessment proposal
    *   14:15: Present assessment proposals
    *   14:30: Coffee
    *   15:00: Overview of lesson materials and how to contribute
    *   15:30: Open discussion
    *   15:45: Minute cards for afternoon session
    *   16:00: Close

## Exercises

*   Learners do think-pair-share for cognitive maps and MCQs.

*   In the two-day versions,
    have learners read the operations guide as their overnight homework
    and do their demotivational story just before lunch on day 2:
    it means day 2 starts with *their* questions (which wakes them up),
    and the demotivational story is a good lead-in to lunchtime discussion.

*   Don't have them complete the Teaching Perspectives Inventory
    or read through the pre- or post-assessment questionnaires in class:
    it kills momentum.

*   Have them work in pairs for the live coding exercise rather than threes,
    and don't bother recording:
    the camera can't pick up both the speaker's body language and what's on the screen.

### Greg Wilson

My daughter is eight years old,
and is going to inherit all the problems my generation did not have the backbone to solve.
Climate change,
mass extinctions,
drug-resistant diseases,
resource shortages:
if we had started working on them twenty years ago we'd be done now,
but instead we ducked and dithered,
so that all those bills are going to come due in her lifetime.

I believe the only things that will get us through the next fifty years are more science and more courage.
I co-founded Software Carpentry to help with the science part of that equation,
but over the last few years I've come to believe that we can help with the courage as well.
We are braver together than we are alone;
by teaching scientists how to collaborate on research today,
we are preparing them to work together on things that really matter tomorrow.
