## Cognitive Development and Mental Models

> It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble.
> It's what you know for sure that just ain't so.
> - Mark Twain

Our goal is not to teach the syntax of a particular programming language,
but to teach people how to think about programming
(and about using computers in research more generally).
Our approach is based on the work of researchers like Benner,
who applied the [Dreyfus model of skill acquisiton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition)
in her studies of
[how nurses progress from novice to expert](http://www.amazon.com/Novice-Expert-Excellence-Clinical-Practice/dp/020100299X/).
In simplified form,
that model has three stages:

*   A *novice* is someone who doesn't know what they don't know, i.e.,
    they don't yet know what the key ideas in the domain are or how they relate.
    More precisely,
    a novice has not yet built a *mental model* of the domain.
    They therefore reason by analogy and guesswork,
    borrowing bits and pieces of their mental models of other domains
    which seem superficially similar.
    One sign that someone is a novice is that their questions "aren't even wrong".
*   A *competent practitioner* is someone who has a mental model that's good enough for everyday purposes.
    This model does not have to be completely accurate in order to be useful:
    for example,
    the average driver's mental model of how a car works probably doesn't include
    most of the complexities that a mechanical engineer would be concerned with.
    Competent practitioners can do normal tasks with normal effort under normal circumstances.
*   An *expert* is someone who can easily handle situations that are out of the ordinary,
    diagnose the causes of problems,
    and so on.
    We will discuss expertise in more detail in [the next lesson](03-cognition.html).

> ## What's in a Model?
>
> What exactly do we mean by a mental model?
> One example is the ball-and-spring model of molecules that most of us encountered in high school chemistry.
> Atoms aren't actually balls,
> and their bonds aren't actually springs,
> but the model does a good job of helping people reason about chemical compounds and their reactions.

One key insight from research on cognitive development is that
novices, competent practitioners, and experts each need to be taught differently.
In particular,
presenting novices with a pile of facts early on is counter-productive,
because they don't yet have a model to fit those facts into.
(In fact,
some research suggests that presenting too many facts too soon can actually reinforce
the incorrect mental model they've cobbled together.)
Instead,
our goal with novices is *to help them construct a working mental model*
so that they have something to attach facts to.

Clearing up their misconceptions is therefore as important as presenting them with correct information.
Broadly speaking,
their misconceptions fall into three categories:

*   Simple *factual errors*, such as believing that Vancouver is the capital of British Columbia.
    These are simple to correct,
    but getting the facts right is not enough on its own.
*   *Broken models*, such as believing that motion and acceleration must be in the same direction.
    We can address these by having them reason through examples to see contradictions.
*   *Fundamental beliefs*,
    such as "the world is only a few thousand years old"
    or "human beings cannot be affecting the planet's climate".
    These usually cannot be addressed in class,
    since they are deeply connected to the learner's social identity
    and cannot be reasoned away.

For example,
Software Carpentry's [lesson on the Unix shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)
only introduces 15 commands in three hours.
That seems very slow to someone who already understands how to use the command line,
but the lesson's real purpose is to teach learners about paths,
history,
wildcards,
pipes and filters,
command-line arguments,
redirection,
and all the other big ideas that the shell depends on,
and without which people cannot understand how to use commands
(or how to read their manual pages).

## Assessment

In order to help people learn efficiently,
instructors need to know whether their learners already understand this topic
(so that the class can move on),
and if not,
what misconceptions and gaps in their knowledge to address.
In short,
instructors need feedback on their learners' progress,
and insight into their learners' mental models.
This is usually done through two kinds of assessment:

*   *Summative assessment* is done at end of teaching
    to tell whether the learning took place
    and whether the learner is ready to move on.
    One example is a driving exam,
    which tells the rest of society whether someone can safely be allowed on the road.
*   *Formative assessment* takes place during teaching and learning.
    Its main purpose is to guide both by telling both the instructor and the learner what to focus on.
    For example,
    a music teacher might ask a student to play a scale very slowly
    in order to see whether she is breathing correctly,
    and if she is not,
    what she should change.
    Its second purpose is to prepare learners for the final summative assessment:
    no one should ever encounter a question on a final exam
    for which the teaching did not prepare them.

> ## Why We Don't Assess During Registration

> Unfortunately,
> most formal educational systems train people to treat all assessment as summative,
> i.e.,

> rather than as a chance to shape instruction.
> For example,

> they shouldn't enrol.
> We were therefore scaring off many of the people we most wanted to help.

In order to be useful during teaching,
a formative assessment has to be quick to administer and evaluate.
The most widely used is probably multiple choice questions (MCQs).
When designed well,
these can do much more than just measure how much someone knows.
For example,
suppose we are teaching children multi-digit addition.
A well-designed MCQ would be:

~~~
Q: what is 27 + 15 ?
a) 42
b) 32
c) 312
d) 33
~~~

The correct answer is 42,
but each of the other answers provides valuable insight:

*   If the child answers 32, she is throwing away the carry completely.
*   If she answers 312, she knows that she can't just discard the carried '1',
    but doesn't understand that it's actually a ten
    and needs to be added into the next column.
    In other words,
    she is treating each column of numbers as unconnected to its neighbors.
*   If she answers 33 then she knows she has to carry the 1,
    but is carrying it back into the same column it came from.

Each of these incorrect answers is a *plausible distractor* with *diagnostic power*.
"Plausible" means that it looks like it could be right:
adults will often put supposedly-silly answers like "a fish!" on MCQs,
but (a) they don't provide any insight
and (b) kids actually don't find them funny.
"Diagnostic power" means that each of the distractors helps the instructor figure out
what to explain to that particular learner next.

Ideally,
instructors should use MCQs
or some other kind of formative assessment
every 10-15 minutes
in order to make sure that the class is actually learning.
Formative assessments can also be used preemptively:
if you start a class with an MCQ and everyone can answer it correctly,
then you can safely skip the part of the lecture
in which you were going to explain something that your learners already know.
(Doing this also helps show learners that the instructor cares about how much they are learning.)

Finally,
designing an MCQ with plausible distractors is useful
even if it is never used in class
because it forces the instructor to think about the learners' mental models
and how they might be broken ---
in short,
to put themselves into the learner's head
and see the topic from their point of view.

## Peer Instruction

No matter how good a teacher is,
she can only say one thing at a time.
How then can she clear up many different misconceptions
in a reasonable time?

The best solution developed so far is a technique called
*[peer instruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_instruction)*.
Originally created by Eric Mazur at Harvard,
it has been studied extensively in a wide variety of contexts, including programming.
When it is used,
the basic learning cycle is typically something like this:

1.  Give a brief introduction to the topic.
2.  Give students an MCQ that probes for misconceptions
    (rather than simple factual knowledge).
3.  Have all the students vote publicly on their answers to the MCQ.
    1.  If the students all have the right answer, move on.
    2.  If they all have the same wrong answer,
        address that specific misconception.
    3.  If they have a mix of right and wrong answers,
        give them several minutes to discuss those answers with one another
        in small groups (typically 2-4 students)
        and then reconvene and vote again.

As [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1&v=2LbuoxAy56o) shows,
group discussion significantly improves students' understanding
because it forces them to clarify their thinking,
which can be enough to call out gaps in reasoning.
Re-polling the class then lets the instructor know if they can move on,
or if further explanation is necessary.
A final round of additional explanation and discussion after the correct answer is presented
gives students one more chance to solidify their understanding.

Peer instruction is essentially a way to provide one-to-one mentorship in a scalable way.
Despite this,
we usually do not use it in our workshops because
it takes people time to learn a new way to learn ---
time that we don't have in our compressed two-day format.
