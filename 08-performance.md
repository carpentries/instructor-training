## Lesson Study

Many people assume that teachers are born, not made.
From politicians to researchers and teachers themselves,
most reformers have designed systems to find and promote those who can teach
and eliminate those who can't.
As Elizabeth Green describes in
*[Building a Better Teacher](http://www.amazon.com/Building-Better-Teacher-Teaching-Everyone/dp/0393081591/)*,
though,
that assumption is wrong,
which is why educational reforms based on it have repeatedly failed.

The book is written as a history of the people who have put that puzzle together in the US.
Its core begins with a discussion of what James Stigler discovered during a visit to Japan in the early 1990s:

> Some American teachers called their pattern "I, We, You":
> After checking homework,
> teachers announced the day's topic,
> demonstrating a new procedure (I)...
> Then they led the class in trying out a sample problem together (We)...
> Finally, they let students work through similar problems on their own,
> usually by silently making their way through a worksheet (You)...
>
> The Japanese teachers, meanwhile, turned "I, We, You" inside out.
> You might call their version "You, Y'all, We."
> They began not with an > introduction,
> but a single problem that students spent ten or twenty > minutes working through alone (You)...
> While the students worked,
> the teacher wove through the students' desks,
> studying what they came up with and taking notes to remember who had which idea.
> Sometimes the teacher then deployed the students to discuss the problem in small > groups (Y'all).
> Next, the teacher brought them back to the whole group,
> asking students to present their different ideas for how to solve the problem on the chalkboard...
> Finally, the teacher led a discussion,
> guiding students to a shared conclusion (We).

It's tempting but wrong to think that this particular teaching technique is Japan's secret sauce.
The actual key is revealed in the description of Akihiko Takahashi's work.
In 1991,
he visited the United States in a vain attempt to find the classrooms described a decade earlier
in a report by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM).
He couldn't find them.
Instead, he found that American teachers met once a year (if that) to exchange ideas about teaching,
compared to the weekly or even daily meetings he was used to.
What was worse:

> The teachers described lessons they gave and things students said,
> but they did not *see* the practices.
> When it came to observing actual lessons --- watching each other teach ---
> they simply had no opportunity...
> They had, he realized, no *jugyokenkyu*.
> Translated literally as "lesson study",
> *jugyokenkyu* is a bucket of practices that Japanese teachers use to hone their craft,
> from observing each other at work to discussing the lesson afterward
> to studying curriculum materials with colleagues.
> The practice is so pervasive in Japanese schools that it is...effectively invisible.
>
> And here lay the answer to [Akihiko's] puzzle.
> Of course the American teachers' work fell short of the model set by their best thinkers...
> Without *jugyokenkyu*, his own classes would have been equally drab.
> Without *jugyokenkyu*, how could you even teach?

So what does *jugyokenkyu* look like in practice?

> In order to graduate,
> education majors not only had to watch their assigned master teacher work,
> they had to effectively replace him,
> installing themselves in his classroom first as observers and then,
> by the third week, as a wobbly...approximation of the teacher himself.
> It worked like a kind of teaching relay.
> Each trainee took a subject,
> planning five days' worth of lessons... [and then] each took a day.
> To pass the baton,
> you had to teach a day's lesson in every single subject:
> the one you planned and the four you did not...
> and you had to do it right under your master teacher's nose.
> Afterward,
> everyone --- the teacher, the college students, and sometimes even another outside observer ---
> would sit around a formal table to talk about what they saw.
>
> [Trainees] stayed in...class until the students left at 3:00 pm,
> and they didn't leave the school until they'd finished discussing the day's events,
> usually around eight o'clock.
> They talked about what [the master teacher] had done,
> but they spent more time poring over how the students had responded:
> what they wrote in their notes;
> the ideas they came up with, right and wrong;
> the architecture of the group discussion.
> The rest of the night was devoted to planning...
>
> ...By the time he arrived in [the US],
> [Akihiko had] become...famous...
> giving public lessons that attracted hundreds,
> and, in one case, an audience of a thousand.
> He had a seemingly magical effect on children...
> But Akihiko knew he was no virtuoso.
> "It is not only me," he always said...
> "*Many* people."
> After all, it was his mentor...who had taught him the new approach to teaching...
> And [he] had crafted the approach along with the other math teachers
> in [his ward] and beyond.
> Together, the group met regularly to discuss their plans for teaching...
> [At] the end of a discussion,
> they'd invite each other to their classrooms to study the results.
> In retrospect,
> this was the most important lesson:
> not how to give a lesson, but how to study teaching,
> using the cycle of *jugyokenkyu* to put...work under a microscope and improve it.

Putting work under a microscope in order to improve it is commonplace in sports and music.
A professional musician, for example,
will dissect half a dozen different recordings of "Body and Soul" or "Smells Like Teen Spirit" before performing it.
They would also expect to get feedback from fellow musicians during practice and after performances.
Many other disciplines work this way too:
the Japanese drew inspiration from [Deming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming)'s ideas
on continuous improvement in manufacturing,
while the adoption of code review over the last 15 years
has done more to improve everyday programming than any number of books or websites.

But this kind of feedback isn't part of teaching culture in English-language school systems:
in the US, Canada, the UK, Australia, and elsewhere,
what happens in the classroom stays in the classroom.
Teachers don't watch each other's lessons on a regular basis,
so they can't borrow each other's good ideas.
The result is that *every teacher has to invent teaching on their own*.
They may get lesson plans and assignments from colleagues,
the school board,
a textbook publisher,
or the Internet,
but each teacher has to figure out on their own how to combine that with
the theory they've learned in education school
to deliver an actual lesson in an actual classroom for actual students.

Sally Fincher and her colleagues studied how teaching practices are actually transferred
using both [a detailed case study](papers/fincher-warrens-question-2007.pdf)
and
[analysis of change stories](papers/fincher-stories-change-2012.pdf).
As the abstract of the latter paper says:

> Innovative tools and teaching practices often fail to be adopted by educators in the field,
> despite evidence of their effectiveness.
> Naïve models of educational change assume this lack of adoption arises from
> failure to properly disseminate promising work,
> but evidence suggests that dissemination via publication is simply not effective...
> We asked educators to describe changes they had made to their teaching practice
> and analyzed the resulting stories...
> Of the 99 change stories analyzed,
> only three demonstrate an active search for new practices or materials on the part of teachers,
> and published materials were consulted in just eight of the stories.
> Most of the changes occurred locally,
> without input from outside sources,
> or involved only personal interaction with other educators.

This is part of the reason for Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry's rule,
"Never teach alone."
Having another instructor in the classroom saves your voice
(it's hard to talk for two days straight),
but more importantly,
it's a chance for instructors to learn from one another.

## In Class

We regard teaching as a performance art,
no different from drama, music, or athletics.
And as in those fields,
we have a collection of small tips and tricks to make teaching work better.

*Open with the [code of conduct](http://software-carpentry.org/conduct.html).*
:   As mentioned in the [previous section](07-motivation.html),
    Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry share a code of conduct,
    and participants in our workshops are required to abide by it.
    Pointing people at it during registration,
    and reminding them of it at the start of the workshop,
    doesn't just tell everyone what the rules are:
    it tells them that there *are* rules,
    and that they can therefore expect a comfortable learning experience.

*Live coding.*
:   We do not use slides in our lessons.
    Instead, instructors plug their laptop into the projector
    and work through the lesson,
    typing in the code,
    reformatting data,
    and talking as we go.
    *   Watching a program being written is more compelling than
        watching someone page through slides that present bits and pieces of the same code.
    *   It enables instructors to be more responsive to "what if?" questions.
        Where a slide deck is like a railway track,
        live coding allows instructors to go off road and follow their learners' interests.
    *   It facilitates lateral knowledge transfer:
        people learn more than we realized we were teaching by watching *how* instructors do things.
    *   It slows the instructor down:
        if she has to type in the program as she goes along,
        she can only go twice as fast as her learners,
        rather than ten-fold faster as she could with slides.
    *   Learners get to see instructors' mistakes *and how to diagnose and correct them*.
        Novices are going to spend most of their time doing this,
        but it's left out of most textbooks.

    It takes a bit of practice for instructors to
    get used to thinking aloud while coding in front of an audience, but
    most report that it is then no more difficult to do than talking off a
    deck of slides.

    Many instructors now use two devices when teaching: a laptop plugged
    into the projector for learners to see, and a tablet beside it on
    which they can view their notes and the Etherpad session.
    This seems to be more reliable than
    displaying one virtual desktop while flipping back and forth to
    another.

*Sticky notes.*
:   We give each learner two sticky notes of different colors,
    e.g., pink and green.
    These can be held up for voting,
    but their real use is as status flags.
    If someone has completed an exercise and wants it checked,
    they put the pink sticky note on their laptop;
    if they run into a problem and need help,
    the put up the green one.
    This is better than having people raise their hands because:
    *   it's more discreet (which means they're more likely to actually do it),
    *   they can keep working while their flag is raised, and
    *   the instructor can quickly see from the front of the room
        what state the class is in.

*Minutes cards.*
:   We also use sticky notes as minute cards: before each coffee or
    meal break, learners take a minute to write one thing they've
    learned on the pink sticky note, and one thing they found
    confusing (or too fast or too slow) on the green one. It only
    takes a few minutes to cluster these, and allows the instructors
    to adjust to learners' interests and speed.

*One up, one down.*
:   We frequently also ask for summary feedback at the end of each day.
    The instructors ask the learners to alternately give one positive and
    one negative point about the day, without repeating anything that has
    already been said.  This requirement forces people to say things they
    otherwise might not: once all the "safe" feedback has been given,
    participants will start saying what they really think.

    Minute cards are anonymous; the alternating up-and-down feedback is
    not.  Each mode has its strengths and weaknesses, and by providing
    both, we hope to get the best of both worls.

*Learners use their own machines.*
:   Learners tell us that it is important to them to leave the workshop
    with their own machine set up to do real work.  We therefore continue
    to teach on all three major platforms (Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows),
    even though it would be simpler to require learners to use just one.

    We have experimented with virtual machines (VMs) on learners'
    computers to reduce installation problems, but those introduce
    problems of their own: older or smaller machines simply aren't fast
    enough, and learners often struggle to switch back and forth between
    two different sets of keyboard shortcuts for things like copying and
    pasting.

    Some instructors use VPS over SSH or web browser pages instead.  This
    solve the installation issues, but makes us dependent on host
    institutions' WiFi (which can be of highly variable quality), and
    has the issues mentioned above with things like keyboard shortcuts.

*Collaborative note-taking.*
:   We often use [Etherpad](http://etherpad.org) for collaborative
    note-taking and to share snippets of code and small data files with
    learners. (If nothing else, it saves us from having to ask students to
    copy long URLs from the presenter's screen to their computers.) It is
    almost always mentioned positively in post-workshop feedback, and
    several workshop participants have started using it in their own
    teaching.

    One of the advantages of collaborative note-taking is that
    it gives the more advanced learners in the class something useful to do.
    Another is that the notes the learners take are usually more helpful *to them*
    than those the instructor would prepare in advance,
    since the learners are more likely to write down what they actually found new,
    rather than what the instructor predicted would be new.
    Finally,
    scanning the Etherpad is a good way for an instructor to discover that
    the class didn't hear something important,
    or misunderstood it.

*Pair programming.*
:   Pairing is a good practice in real life, and also
    [a good way to teach](papers/porter-what-works-2013.pdf).
    Partners can not only help each other out during the practical,
    but can also clarify each other's misconceptions when the solution is
    presented, and discuss common research interests during breaks. To
    facilitate this, we strongly prefer flat (dinner-style) seating to
    banked (theater-style) seating; this also makes it easier for helpers
    to reach learners who need assistance.

    When pair programming is used it's important to put *everyone* in pairs,
    not just the learners who are struggling,
    so that no one feels singled out.
    It's also useful to have people sit in new places (and hence pair with different partners)
    after each coffee or meal break.

## Pace and Level

Given the diversity of our learners' backgrounds and skills, we will
always have a mix of more and less advanced people in our classes.  No
matter what we teach, and how fast or how slow we go, 20% or more of
the room will be lost, and there's a good chance that a different 20%
will be bored.

The obvious solution is to split people by level,
but if we ask them how much they know about particular things,
they regularly under- or over-estimate their knowledge.
We have therefore developed a short pre-assessment questionnaire
that asks them how easily they could do a small number of specific tasks.
It gives instructors some idea of who they're going to be helping,
but we have not validated the questions,
i.e.,
we have not done the laborious work of interviewing respondents
to ensure that they are interpreting the questions the same way that we are.
We also have not yet done the follow-up to see
whether the questionnaires' categorization of learners
matches their actual in-class proficiency.

> ## You Can't Just Ask
>
> Instead of asking people how easily they could complete specific tasks,
> we could just ask them to rate their knowledge of various subjects
> on a scale from 1 to 5.
> However,
> self-assessments of this kind are usually inaccurate
> because of the [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect):
> the less people know about a subject,
> the less accurate their estimate of their knowledge is.

That said, there *are* things we can do:

*   Before running a workshop,
    communicate its level clearly to everyone who's thinking of signing up
    by listing the topics that will be covered
    and showing a few examples of exercises that people will be asked to complete.
*   Provide multiple exercises for each teaching episode
    so that more advanced learners don't finish early and get bored.
*   Ask more advanced learners to help people next to them.
    They'll learn from answering their peers' questions
    (since it will force them to think about things in new ways).
*   The helpers and the instructor who isn't teaching the particular episode
    should keep an eye out for learners who are falling behind
    and intervene early
    so that they don't become frustrated and give up.

The most important thing is to accept that
no class can possibly meet everyone's individual needs.
If the instructor slows down to accommodate two people who are struggling,
the other 38 are not being well served.
Equally,
if she spends a few minutes talking about an advanced topic because two learners are bored,
the 38 who don't understand it will feel left out.
All we can do is tell our learners what we're doing and why,
and hope that they'll understand.

## Workshop Operations

Starting in January 2015 we began running bi-weekly debriefing
sessions for instructors who have recently taught workshops.  In
these, instructors discuss what they actually did, how it worked, how
the lessons they actually delivered differed from our templates, what
problems arose, and so on.

Summaries are posted on our blog shortly after each meeting.
More importantly,
we have condensed this feedback (and much else)
in an [operations guide](http://software-carpentry.org/workshops/operations.html)
and a set of checklists
that describes what everyone in a workshop is expected to do and why.
