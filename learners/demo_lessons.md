title: Suggested Lessons for Teaching Demonstrations
---

The list below shows lessons that have been reviewed for good and bad start points to use for a teaching demonstration. When selecting a lesson for a
teaching demonstration, trainees should review this list to ensure it is suitable.

Those who wish may also consult the detailed tables following the list to identify episodes marked "avoid" because they will not be asked to teach those episodes. However, we recommend
reviewing the full lesson regardless, as this will help provide context for other start points and is also good preparation for your eventual teaching
role!

Note that while a trainee can choose the lesson to teach from, the **Trainer leading the demo session will choose the specific episode at the time
of the demo session.** If you would like to use a lesson that is not listed here, you may contact the Instructor Trainer leading your teaching
demonstration or (if no one is listed for your session) email [instructor.training@carpentries.org](mailto:instructor.training@carpentries.org).

If the episode chosen by the trainer is very short and finishes in less than 5 minutes, the trainee can continue on to the next episode in that lesson. They are not
required to cover any specific amount of content within the 5 minute period.
