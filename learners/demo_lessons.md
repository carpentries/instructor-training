title: Lessons for Teaching Demonstrations
---

The list below shows lessons that have been reviewed for good and bad start points to use for a teaching demonstration. When selecting an episode for a
teaching demonstration, trainees should review this list to ensure it is suitable.

As of 14 August 2023, trainees are allowed to choose the episode from which their 5-minute teaching demo will begin. However,  still we recommend
reviewing the full lesson during preparation, as this will help provide context for instruction and is also good preparation for teaching a 
complete workshop later on!

If a selected episode is very short and finishes in less than 5 minutes, it may be necessary to continue on to the next episode in that lesson 
to complete a 5 minute demonstration. 
It is **not** necessary to teach the full episode, or to cover any specific amount of content within the 5 minute period.

**NB: If your preferred lesson is not on the list or includes only ineligible episodes, please choose a different lesson.** 
If you believe you have a lesson or episode that should be eligible but is not on the list, please email us at [instructor.training@carpentries.org](mailto:instructor.training@carpentries.org).

## Teaching Episodes with Dependencies {#dependencies}

Many Carpentries lessons follow a narrative: an example that runs from episode to episode,
with the same data, files, variables, etc reused and modified as new skills and concepts are taught
to Learners.
This means that the content of later episodes in a lesson is likely to depend on the steps
that have taken place earlier in the lesson.

The _Recommended Episodes_ column of the tables below provides a list
of episodes that do not depend heavily on any of the preceding content in the lesson.
**If you choose to teach one of the episodes not in this list of recommendations, 
you should take care to ensure that you have everything set up
as if the preceding parts of the lesson have already been taught
before your teaching demonstration begins.**

## Ineligible Episodes for Teaching Demos {#ineligible}

Some lessons include episodes that **cannot be used for a teaching demonstration**,
usually because they contain little or no opportunity for teaching by live demonstration.
These episodes are listed in the _Not Eligible for Demos_ column of the tables below.

## Enseñanza de episodios con dependencias {#dependencies-es}

Muchas lecciones en *Carpentries* siguen una narrativa común: Un mismo ejemplo
que va de episodio en episodio, con datos, archivos, variables, etc. que son
reutilizados y modificados a medida que nuevas habilidades y conceptos son
enseñados a los alumnos. Esto significa que el contenido de los episodios
dependerá probablemente de los pasos que se hayan dado en episodios anteriores
de una misma lección.

La columna _Episodios Recomendados_ en la tabla siguiente proporciona
una lista de episodios que no dependen en gran medida de ninguno de los
contenidos anteriores de la lección. Si decide enseñar uno de los episodios que
no figuran en esta lista de recomendaciones, deberá asegurarse de que todo está
preparado como si las partes anteriores de la lección ya se hubieran enseñado
antes de comenzar su demostración didáctica.

## Episodios no aptos para la demostración didáctica {#ineligible-es}

Algunas lecciones incluyen episodios que **no pueden ser utilizados para una
demostración didáctica**, normalmente porque contienen poca o ninguna
oportunidad para la enseñanza mediante demostraciones en vivo. Estos episodios
se enumeran en la columna _No elegible para demostraciones_ en la tabla
siguiente.
