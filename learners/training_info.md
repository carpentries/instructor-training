title: 'Information: The Carpentries Instructor Training'
---

## General Information
[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) is a community of practice centered around teaching foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide. 
This Instructor Training event is designed to prepare trainees to certify and participate as Carpentries Instructors. 
However, much of our curriculum focuses on educational principles that apply across a wide variety of contexts. 
We also welcome participants who do not plan to certify but simply wish to become a better teacher.

Carpentries Instructor Training has the following goals:

* Introduce you to evidence-based teaching practices.
* Teach you how to create a positive environment for learners at your workshops.
* Provide opportunities for you to practice and build your teaching skills.
* Help you become integrated into the Carpentries community.
* Prepare you to use these teaching skills in teaching Carpentries workshops.

Because we have only limited time, some things are beyond the scope of this training. 
We will not be learning:

* How to program in R or Python, use Git or SQL, or any of the other topics taught in [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/), [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org/), or [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) workshops.
* How to create your own lessons from scratch. However, this Instructor Training serves as a good precursor to [The Carpentries Collaborative Lesson Development Training](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-development-training/).

Instructor Training events are hands-on throughout: short lessons alternate with individual and group practical exercises, including practice teaching sessions.
This Instructor Training event is the first step towards certification as a Carpentries Instructor. 
For more details on the other 3 steps, see the [Checkout Instructions](../learners/checkout.md) page.
For more information, see our [Instructor Training Curriculum](../index.md).

A brief summary of these instructions is as follows:

1. Complete our Pre-training Survey. You will receive a custom link for your event when you receive your connection information.
1. Select a lesson to use for teaching practice sessions and prepare a 3 minute segment, spending no more than 20-30 minutes to prepare.
1. Please read the following:
    * [The Science of Learning](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/files/papers/science-of-learning-2015.pdf)
    * The Carpentries Annual Report (most recent version from [The Carpentries Impact page](https://carpentries.org/about-us/impact/)

### Checkout: The Instructor Certification Process
After the training event, we ask you to complete three follow-up tasks to become a certified Instructor.
These requirements are detailed on our [Checkout Instructions](../learners/checkout.md) page and will be discussed at our training.

### What to Bring to an In-Person Event
[Most Instructor Training events take place online](#where).
If your training will take place in-person, please bring a laptop that is Internet connected and has a functioning browser. 
If you have it, a device for recording audio and video (mobile phones and laptops are OK) is useful as we are going to record one another teaching in pairs or threes. 
It does not have to be high-quality, but it should be good enough that you can understand what someone is saying.

### Attendance and Cancellation
Trainees who miss more than 1 hour of the training may be marked absent.
Instructor certification cannot be completed without full attendance at an Instructor Training event. 
If you unexpectedly need to miss more than 1 hour of your event, please contact your Trainers using the details provided in the information email for your event or [email us](mailto:instructor.training@carpentries.org).

For events in which registration occurs through The Carpentries via Eventbrite, cancellation may be performed in Eventbrite up to the start of the event.
Canceled seats cannot be filled after the 1 week registration deadline for these events, so we ask that you only cancel if absolutely necessary.

More information on our [cancellation and makeup policy](https://docs.carpentries.org/handbooks/instructors.html#instructor-training-attendance-policy) is available in The Carpentries Handbook.
