*   **Authentic Task**:
    A task which contains important elements of things that learners would
    do in real (non-classroom situations).  To be authentic, a task should
    require learners to construct their own answers rather than choose
    between provided answers, and to work with the same tools and data
    they would use in real life.

*   **Behaviorism**:
    A theory of learning whose central principle is stimulus and response,
    and whose goal is to explain behavior without recourse to internal
    mental states or other unobservables.
    <br>
    See also *cognitivism*.

*   **Chunking**:
    The act of grouping related concepts together so that they can be
    stored and processed as a single unit.

*   **Cognitive Load Theory**:
    [Cognitive load][wikipedia-cognitive-load] is the amount of mental
    effort required to solve a problem.  Cognitive load theory divides
    this effort into *intrinsic*, *extraneous*, and *germane*, and holds
    that people learn faster and better when extraneous load is reduced.

*   **Cognitivism**:
    A theory of learning that holds that mental states and processes can
    and must be included in models of learning.
    <br>
    See also *behaviorism*.

    The ability to move quickly between different models of a problem.

    See also *summative assessment*.

*   **General Pedagogical Knowledge**:

    The craft of creating and evaluating specific lessons for specific
    audiences.
    <br>
    See also *educational psychology*.
