#### Carpentries Member Site Instructor Training Calendar
###  September to December 2018


If you are a member site ready to schedule your instructor training session, please contact maneesha@carpentries.org with your first and second choices for dates.  If you do not see a training in your time zone, please contact maneesha@carpentries.org.

All trainings are offered online from 9 am to 5 pm in the time zone noted.  You do not need to be in the same time zone yourself but need to accommodate that time zone.
