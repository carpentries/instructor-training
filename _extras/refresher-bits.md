# Short Reminder and Refresher Text for Instructor Training
## Dismissive language
Have you caught yourself using "the J Word" lately? Do you reassure your learners that they can be successful by suggesting 
that a task is "easy"? Don't forget to remember: tasks that are familiar to you but are new to your learners are rarely easy
for learners! Asking learners to "just" perform a task suggests to them that, if it is hard for them, there might be something
wrong with them. By signalling that you don't expect them to have trouble, you also signal that you aren't expecting them to need
help. It's "easy" to use this kind of language in a well-intentioned way, with un-intended consequences. To maximize learner comfort in your classroom, keep this fresh in your 
mind, try to catch yourself, and think about steps you might take to correct these language errors when you teach!
