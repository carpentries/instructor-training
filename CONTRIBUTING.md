## Getting Started

1.  Please see [the README][getting-giving-help]
    for advice on getting and giving help.

2.  We use GitHub flow to manage changes,
    which is explained in the chapter [Contributing to a Project][pro-git-chapter]
    in Scott Chacon's book *Pro Git*.

3.  For our lessons,
    you should branch from and submit pull requests against the `gh-pages` branch.

4.  When editing lesson pages, only commit changes to the Markdown source files.

5.  If you're looking for things to work on,
    please see [the list of issues for this repository][lesson-template-issues]
    or have a look at [our actual lessons][swc-lessons].
    Comments on issues and reviews of pull requests are equally welcome.
