title: Instructor Training
---
This short training course introduces the basics of educational
psychology and instructional design, and shows them how to use them to
teach programming to free-range adult learners.  Each lesson includes
a theory of how people learn or a teaching technique, with a specific
focus on applying these ideas and tools to computational instruction.
It is necessarily shallow, but we hope it will be useful and convince
you to learn more.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> There are no specific prerequisites for this training,
> but participants will benefit from having been through
> a Data Carpentry or Software Carpentry workshop
> so that they are familiar with our teaching techniques.
