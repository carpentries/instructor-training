Over the last hundred years,
researchers have discovered an enormous amount about how people learn
and how best to teach them.
Unfortunately,
much of that knowledge has not yet been translated into common classroom practice,
while many myths about education have proven remarkably persistent.

This two-day class will introduce participants to a handful of key research findings
and show how they can be used to help people learn better and faster.
We will look at
the cognitive differences between novices, competent practitioners, and experts;
why those differences require different pedagogical approaches;
how to design formative assessments to provide feedback to both instructors and students while learning is taking place;
how to mitigate cognitive load during learning;
how concept maps can be used both to design lessons and to communicate those designs;
how practices similar to pair programming and test-driven design can be used in education;
and how teaching is a performance art.

[Software Carpentry]({{ site.swc_site }}) has run variations on this course since 2012 for over 500 people,
and the present material is relevant to anyone trying to teach basic programming skills to adults.
The class will be hands-on:
short lessons will alternate with individual and group practical exercises,
including practice teaching sessions.
Those who complete the two full days
and [some short follow-up exercises online]({{ site.root }}/checkout/)
will be certified to teach [Software Carpentry]({{ site.swc_site }})
and/or [Data Carpentry]({{ site.dc_site }}).

    but participants will benefit from having been through a Data Carpentry or Software Carpentry workshop
    so that they are familiar with our teaching techniques.
