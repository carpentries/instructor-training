Welcome to The Carpentries Instructor Training curriculum! Originally released in 2016, this resource is collaboratively maintained and taught by The Carpentries Instructor Trainer community. Minor changes occur routinely; major updates are chronicled in our [release history](https://github.com/carpentries/instructor-training/releases).

### A note about instructor view

The instructor view has a few features that the learner view does not have:

1. instructor notes like this one where instructors can provide guidance about
  how the particular episode is taught in practice **(you can find an example of
  this in the [How We Operate episode](episodes/15-carpentries.md))**.
2. aggregated timing estimates
3. a schedule integrated into the index page

You can enter instructor view at any time by selecting the dropdown menu at the
top right of the page or you can edit the URL and place `/instructor/` before
the html page.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Carpentries Instructor Training has the following goals:

- Introduce you to evidence-based teaching practices.
- Teach you how to create a positive environment for learners at your workshops.
- Provide opportunities for you to practice and build your teaching skills.
- Help you become integrated into the [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) community.
- Prepare you to use these teaching skills in teaching [Carpentries workshops](https://carpentries.org/workshops/).

Because we have only limited time, some things are beyond the scope of this training. We will not be learning:

- How to program in R or Python, use the Unix shell, Git or SQL, or any of the other topics taught in Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry, or Software Carpentry workshops.
- How to create your own lessons from scratch (although you will have a good start on the principles behind that sort of work if you are inspired to learn more, for example in our [lesson development training][cldt-curriculum]).

If you would like to attend Instructor Training, please visit the [Become an Instructor page](https://carpentries.org/become-instructor/) on
The Carpentries website for details on admission.

Instructor Training events are hands-on throughout: short lessons alternate with individual
and group practical exercises, including practice teaching sessions. Those who attend the
full training and all three checkout steps will be certified as a Carpentries Instructor
and will be eligible to teach [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/), [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org/),
and [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) workshops throughout our global community.

- All participants are required to abide by our [Code of Conduct][conduct].
- There are no specific prerequisites for this training, but participants will benefit from having attended a Data Carpentry, Software Carpentry, or Library Carpentry workshop either as learner or helper so that they are familiar with our teaching techniques and the style of our workshops.
- Participants are not required to have any specific programming skills (though they should know enough about the subjects of one or more of our lessons to be able to teach them).
  An Instructor Training event is the first step towards certification as a Carpentries Instructor. For more details on the other 3 steps, see the [Checkout Instructions page](learners/checkout.md) on this site.

### Scheduling Notes

The schedule below aggregates time over nearly 16 straight hours.  
The curriculum is broken in to four parts, labeled with start and end episodes
and one break episode in each part. In a 2 day training, parts correspond to 
half days, with the "end part 1" and "end part 3" episodes used as lunch breaks; 
in a 4 day training, parts correspond to days and the time allocated to those
two episodes is skipped. 

A common modification is to switch from one break roughly at the middle of each 
part to two breaks at about 1/3 and 2/3 through the part.
