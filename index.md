Over the last hundred years,
researchers have discovered an enormous amount about how people learn
and how best to teach them.
Unfortunately,
much of that knowledge has not yet been translated into common classroom practice, especially at the university level.

This two-day class has the following overall goals:

*   Introduce you to evidence-based best-practices of teaching.
*   Teach you how to create a positive environment for learners at your workshops.
*   Provide opportunities for you to practice and build your teaching skills.
*   Help you become integrated into the Carpentry community. 
*   Prepare you to use these teaching skills in teaching Carpentry workshops.

Because we have only two days, some things are beyond the scope of this class. We will not be learning:  

*   How to program in R or Python, use git, or any of the other topics taught in Carpentry workshops.   
*   How to create your own lessons from scratch (although you will have a good start on the principles behind that sort of work if you're inspired to learn more). 

*Please fill in [this form][application-form] if you wish to take part in this course.
Priority is given to members of our partner organizations,
but we run several open-enrollment classes each year as well.*

The class will be hands-on throughout:
short lessons will alternate with individual and group practical exercises,
including practice teaching sessions.
Those who complete the two full days
and [some short follow-up exercises online]({{ page.root }}/checkout/)
will be certified to teach [Software Carpentry]({{ site.swc_site }})
and [Data Carpentry]({{ site.dc_site }}) workshops.

*   All participants in this course are required to abide by our [Code of Conduct][conduct].
*   There are no specific prerequisites for this training,
    but participants will benefit from having been through a Data Carpentry or Software Carpentry workshop
    so that they are familiar with our teaching techniques.
*   In particular, participants are *not* required to have any specific programming skills
    (though of course they should know enough about the subjects of one or more of our lessons
    to be able to teach them).
