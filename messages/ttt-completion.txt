Thanks again for taking part in Software Carpentry instructor training - we're pleased to have you on the team.  When you have a minute, please:

1. Take a moment to go to [1] and update your profile so we know where you are and what you're comfortable teaching - that will help us match you with workshops.

2. Send me a three-line bio and a photo to add to our website (see [2] for examples).

3. Make sure you're on the 'instructors' mailing list (signup at [3]) so that you'll get notice about upcoming workshops that need instructors - if you'd like us to help you organize one where you are, please give me a shout.

Please also join the discussion list (signup also at [3]) - it's low traffic and high signal-to-noise, and it'd be great to have your input on what we're doing.

Hope to teach with you some day,
Thanks,
Greg
