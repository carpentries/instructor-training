Before we discuss how to teach and how to design lessons,
we need to define a few terms.

## Educational Psychology

*Educational psychology* is the study of how people learn.
It touches on everything from the neuropsychology of perception and the mechanisms of memory
to the sociology of school systems
and the philosophical question of what we actually mean by "learning"
(which turns out to be pretty complicated once you start looking beyond
the standardized Western classroom).

Within the broad scope of educational pyschology,
this training will take a narrow *cognitivist* perspective.
We can afford to do this because most of our learners are
physically safe, well fed, well educated, and highly motivated.
Much of the research in education has rightly focused on people without these privileges.

> ## Other Perspectives
>
> There are many other perspectives outside cognitivist theory ---
> see [this site](http://www.learning-theories.com/) for summaries.
> Besides cognitivism, those encountered most frequently include
> *behaviorism* (which treats education as stimulus/response conditioning),
> *constructivism* (which considers learning an active process
> during which learners construct knowledge for themselves),
> and *connectivism* (which emphasizes the social aspects of learning,
> particularly those made possible by the Internet).

## Instructional Design

While what we know about educational psychology can constrain teaching,
it doesn't dictate it.
In particular,
there are often several plausible approaches to teaching
that are consistent with what we know about how brains learn.
In order to decide between them,
we also need to explore *instructional design*,
which is the study of how to create learning materials.
If educational psychology is the science,
ID is the engineering:
it's how our scientific understanding is put into practice on the ground.

For example,
most children today are taught to read using a bottom-up technique called
[phonics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonics),
which introduces them to the sounds of letters,
then puts those letters and their sounds together to make simple words like "bug" and "run",
then assembles the words into sentences and stories.
But another technique called [whole language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_language)
takes a different approach.
Instead of starting with letters,
its proponents teach children to recognize entire words
so that they get the positive feedback of being able to read whole stories as early as possible.
The basic idea is that once children find reading rewarding,
they'll be motivated to go back and figure out the letters.

Both approaches are consistent with what we know about how children learn,
so we need to study them in action to determine which is better.
The findings have been contradictory:
while some studies find that phonics works best,
others show that whole language yields better results.

One explanation is that a third factor is at play.
If children sense that their teachers are enthusiastic about something,
they will respond to that enthusiasm and learn better.
If they feel their teachers are just marking time,
though,
they will emulate that instead.
Thus,
when studies are done by people who are proponents of a new technique
(as they often are),
they are likely to produce positive results,
but when those techniques are deployed more widely
to teachers who have seen one bandwagon after another roll by,
results will regress to the mean.

This course will cover several methods and tools of instructional design,
exploring their strengths and weaknesses,
and trying to connect them to the underlying research.

> ## Quantitative and Qualitative Research
>
> One of the major challenges in educational research is that
> human beings are very different from one another.
> In order to get meaningful quantitative results,
> studies must therefore include large numbers of subjects,
> which is expensive.
> Quantitative studies are also not able to answer many "why" questions.
> For those,
> researchers need to use qualitative methods,
> such as [grounded theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grounded_theory).
> Physical scientists are sometimes sceptical of such studies and their findings,
> but done rigorously,
> they can provide actionable insights that quantitative methods cannot.

## Pedagogical Content Knowledge

In the end, effective teaching often depends on what the teacher knows.
The things teachers know can be divided into:

*   *content knowledge*, such as the "what" of programming;

*   *general pedagogical knowledge*, i.e., an understanding of the
    psychology of learning; and

*   the *pedagogical content knowledge* (PCK) that connects the two,
    which is things like when to teach the notion of a call stack
    and what examples to use when doing so.

This training course focuses on general pedagogical knowledge
through the two major categories
(educational psychology and instructional design) described above.
It assumes you know as much as you need to about basic programming
(our content knowledge).

We *wish* the course could include a lot more material on PCK than it does,
but computing education lags behind fields like mathematics
when it comes to assembling and organizing this.  Within
Software Carpentry, we are trying to support the curation of PCK by including
an instructor's guide with each lesson that describes particular teaching
techniques for that lesson's content.

> ## Examples of PCK
>
> *   Gelman and Nolan's *[Teaching Statistics: A Bag of Tricks](http://www.amazon.com/Teaching-Statistics-Tricks-Andrew-Gelman/dp/0198572247/)*
>     is full of PCK for teaching introductory statistics.
> *   The [CS Teaching Tips](http://csteachingtips.org/) site
>     is gathering similar ideas for computing.

We have attempted to apply our knowledge of how people learn
and our recommendations for instructional design
within the format of these lessons.

## Key Readings

The best overview of research results in education and learning is
Ambrose et al's *[How Learning Works: Seven Research-Based Principles for Smart Teaching](http://www.amazon.com/How-Learning-Works-Research-Based-Jossey-Bass/dp/0470484101/)*,
which is also an excellent example of what secondary literature ought to look like.
Green's *[Building a Better Teacher](http://www.amazon.com/Building-Better-Teacher-Teaching-Everyone/dp/0393081591)*
is lighter but no less informative:
it explores why educational reforms in the past 50 years have mostly missed the mark,
and what we should be doing instead.

Shorter pieces include
Guzdial' "[Why Programming is Hard to Teach](http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/guzdial.pdf)"
and Porter et al's "[Success in Introductory Programming: What Works?](http://files.software-carpentry.org/2013/08/p34-porter.pdf)",
both of which should be read before starting this class.

> ## Who Decides?
>
> In Littky and Grabelle's *[The Big Picture: Education is Everyone's Business](http://www.amazon.com/Big-Picture-Education-Everyones-Business/dp/0871209713/)*,
> Kenneth Wesson wrote,
> "If poor inner-city children consistently outscored children from wealthy suburban homes on standardized tests,
> is anyone naive enough to believe that we would still insist on using these tests as indicators of success?"
> What are examples in your own experience of "objective" assessments that reinforce the status quo?
